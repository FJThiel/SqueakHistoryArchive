As a consequence, the user cannot revert to the original color with a simple click on that box. This can be frustrating. Here is a fix. I've also added a selectedColor printString to theSelectorDisplayMorph."!!ColorPickerMorph methodsFor: 'initialization' stamp: 'LC 2/2/2000 03:18'!updateSelectorDisplay	theSelectorDisplayMorph position: self bottomLeft.	theSelectorDisplayMorph firstSubmorph contents: selector asString , ' ' , selectedColor printString! !!ColorPickerMorph methodsFor: 'event handling' stamp: 'LC 2/2/2000 03:34'!mouseDown: evt	| localPt |	localPt _ evt cursorPoint - self topLeft.	(DragBox containsPoint: localPt)		ifTrue: [^ evt hand grabMorph: self].	(RevertBox containsPoint: localPt)		ifTrue: [^ self updateColor: originalColor feedbackColor: originalColor].	self comeToFront.	sourceHand _ evt hand.	self startStepping.! !!ColorPickerMorph methodsFor: 'private' stamp: 'LC 2/2/2000 03:17'!updateTargetColor	| nArgs |	(target ~~ nil and: [selector ~~ nil]) ifTrue:		[self updateSelectorDisplay.		nArgs _ selector numArgs.		nArgs = 1 ifTrue:[^target perform: selector with: selectedColor].		nArgs = 2 ifTrue:[^target perform: selector with: selectedColor with: sourceHand].		nArgs = 3 ifTrue:[^target perform: selector with: selectedColor with: argument with: sourceHand]].! !!ColorPickerMorph methodsFor: 'other' stamp: 'LC 2/2/2000 04:28'!containsPoint: aPoint 	^ (super containsPoint: aPoint)		or: [RevertBox containsPoint: aPoint - self topLeft]! !
