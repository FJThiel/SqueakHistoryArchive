When this method tries to determine the patch level by calling ''ChangeSorter highestNumberedChangeSet'' the ChangeSorter class has already been stripped.This changeset works around this problem."!!SystemDictionary methodsFor: 'sources, change log' stamp: 'sma 2/12/2000 12:42'!lastUpdateString	"Smalltalk lastUpdateString"	| aNumber |	aNumber _ (Smalltalk		at: #ChangeSorter		ifAbsent: [^ 'Update # unknown']) highestNumberedChangeSet.	^ (aNumber notNil and: [aNumber > 0])		ifTrue: ['latest update: #' , aNumber printString]		ifFalse: ['No updates present.']! !
