'From Squeak3.7alpha of ''11 September 2003'' [latest update: #5420] on 1 December 2003 at 4:43:39 pm'!"Change Set:		ifEmpty-etc-jfDate:			1 December 2003Author:			Julian FitzellNed submitted a fix back in September for several RB issues.  One of the pieces of that fix was the set of ifEmpty/ifNotEmpty methods.  There was some discussion and it was agreed that they should all take 0-arg blocks in all their forms and we could add #ifEmptyDo:, etc. at a later point if desired.  No revised fix for these methods was submitted and they never made it in.So I wrote them up and here they are."!!Collection methodsFor: 'testing' stamp: 'jf 12/1/2003 15:37'!ifEmpty: aBlock	"Evaluate the block if I'm empty"	^ self isEmpty ifTrue: aBlock! !!Collection methodsFor: 'testing' stamp: 'jf 12/1/2003 15:39'!ifEmpty: emptyBlock ifNotEmpty: notEmptyBlock	"Evaluate emptyBlock if I'm empty, notEmptyBlock otherwise"	^ self isEmpty ifTrue: emptyBlock ifFalse: notEmptyBlock! !!Collection methodsFor: 'testing' stamp: 'jf 12/1/2003 15:37'!ifNotEmpty: aBlock	"Evaluate the block unless I'm empty"	^ self isEmpty ifFalse: aBlock! !!Collection methodsFor: 'testing' stamp: 'jf 12/1/2003 15:47'!ifNotEmpty: notEmptyBlock ifEmpty: emptyBlock	"Evaluate emptyBlock if I'm empty, notEmptyBlock otherwise"	^ self isEmpty ifFalse: notEmptyBlock ifTrue: emptyBlock! !
