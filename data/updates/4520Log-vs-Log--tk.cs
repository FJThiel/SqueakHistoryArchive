Object>>log: writes a message into the Transcript. 	In this conflict, the math convention wins.  I am removing Object>>log:.  	It arrived in 2578httpLoader-mir, and was not even used in that changeSet."!!ServerAction methodsFor: 'URL processing' stamp: 'tk 11/15/2001 17:51'!log: pieces to: request	| ent1 ent2 |	ent1 _ (Time now printString), String tab, (Date today printString), String tab.	ent2 _ (pieces printString), String cr.	request log: ent1, ent2.! !Object removeSelector: #log:!
