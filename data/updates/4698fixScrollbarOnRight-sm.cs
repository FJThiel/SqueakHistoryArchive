This change attempts to remedy that by bringing the current pane (and it's owner, for the class pane in browsers) to the front when showing a scroll bar."!!ScrollPane methodsFor: 'scrolling' stamp: 'sm 11/30/2001 22:32'!showScrollBar	(submorphs includes: scrollBar)		ifTrue: [^ self].	self resizeScrollBar.	self privateAddMorph: scrollBar atIndex: 1.	"scrollBar changed."	scrollBarOnLeft		ifFalse: [			"Bring the pane to the front so that it is fully visible"			self comeToFront.			self owner comeToFront].	retractableScrollBar		ifFalse: [self resetExtent]! !
