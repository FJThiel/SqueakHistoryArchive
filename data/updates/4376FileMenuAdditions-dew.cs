'From Squeak3.1alpha of 7 February 2001 [latest update: #3536] on 9 February 2001 at 1:37:18 am'!"Change Set:		FileMenuAdditions-dewDate:			9 February 2001Author:			Doug WayAdds 'fileIn', 'file into new change set', and 'browse code' menu items to the file (text area) menu, to go along with 'browse changes' (so that it's similar to the file list menu).  This will make it easier for people to file in and browse changesets if they open them via the open.../file... menu.  Also removes 'fileIn selection', since it's already in the shift menu."!!FileList methodsFor: 'file list menu' stamp: 'dew 2/9/2001 01:13'!fileContentsMenu: aMenu shifted: shifted| shiftMenu |^ shifted 	ifFalse: [aMenu 		labels: 'get entire fileview as hexfileInfile into new change setbrowse changesbrowse codefind...(f)find again (g)set search string (h)do again (j)undo (z)copy (c)cut (x)paste (v)paste...do it (d)print it (p)inspect it (i)accept (s)cancel (l)more...' 		lines: #(2 6 9 11 15 18 20)		selections: #(get getHexfileInSelection fileIntoNewChangeSet browseChanges browseFilefind findAgain setSearchStringagain undocopySelection cut paste pasteRecentdoIt printIt inspectItaccept cancelshiftedYellowButtonActivity)]	ifTrue: [shiftMenu _ ParagraphEditor shiftedYellowButtonMenu.		aMenu 			labels: shiftMenu labelString 			lines: shiftMenu lineArray			selections: shiftMenu selections]! !
