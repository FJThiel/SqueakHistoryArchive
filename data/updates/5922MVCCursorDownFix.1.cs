This works for instances of NewParagraph, but not for instances of Paragraph. To obtain the number of lines in a paragraph, one has to write 'paragraph numberOfLines'."!!ParagraphEditor methodsFor: 'private' stamp: 'BG 4/29/2004 11:19'!sameColumn: start newLine: lineBlock forward: isForward	"Private - Compute the index in my text	with the line number derived from lineBlock,"	" a one argument block accepting the old line number.	The position inside the line will be preserved as good as possible"	"The boolean isForward is used in the border case to determine if	we should move to the beginning or the end of the line."	| wordStyle column currentLine offsetAtTargetLine targetEOL lines numberOfLines currentLineNumber targetLineNumber |	wordStyle _ Preferences wordStyleCursorMovement.	wordStyle		ifTrue: [			lines _ paragraph lines.			numberOfLines := paragraph numberOfLines.			currentLineNumber  _ paragraph lineIndexOfCharacterIndex: start.			currentLine _ lines at: currentLineNumber]		ifFalse: [			lines _ self lines.			numberOfLines := lines size.			currentLine _ lines				detect:[:lineInterval | lineInterval last >= start]				ifNone:[lines last].			currentLineNumber _ currentLine second].	column _ start - currentLine first.	targetLineNumber _ ((lineBlock value: currentLineNumber) max: 1) min: numberOfLines.	offsetAtTargetLine _ (lines at: targetLineNumber) first.	targetEOL _ (lines at: targetLineNumber) last + (targetLineNumber == numberOfLines ifTrue:[1]ifFalse:[0]).	targetLineNumber == currentLineNumber	"No movement or movement failed.
