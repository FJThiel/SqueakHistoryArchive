LewisAdds a range check for Utilities>>floatPrcisionForDecimalPlaces: anda default implementation that works when the parameter is out of range.Implementation note:I used #caseOf:otherwise: to implement this. The result is about 25% slowerthan the original unchecked method. I got very slightly faster performanceby writing it with a bunch of #ifTrue: lines, but I think the caseOf approachis slightly less ugly.All other implementations that I tried (including #at:ifAbsent:, and #on:do)were significantly slower, so I settled on #caseOf:otherwise: for clarity andreasonable speed."!!Utilities class methodsFor: 'miscellaneous' stamp: 'dtl 11/25/2004 22:10'!floatPrecisionForDecimalPlaces: places	"Answer the floatPrecision that corresponds to the given number of decimal places"	^ places caseOf:			{[0]->[1] .			[1]->[0.1] . 			[2]->[0.01] .			[3]->[0.001] .			[4]->[0.0001] .			[5]->[0.00001] .			[6]->[0.000001] .			[7]->[0.0000001] .			[8]->[0.00000001] .			[9]->[0.000000001]}		otherwise:			[(10.0 raisedTo: places negated) asFloat]"(0 to: 6) collect: [:i | Utilities floatPrecisionForDecimalPlaces: i](-10 to: 20) collect: [:i | Utilities floatPrecisionForDecimalPlaces: i]"! !
