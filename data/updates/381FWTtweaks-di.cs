'From Squeak 2.2 of Sept 23, 1998 on 2 November 1998 at 2:29:19 pm'!"Change Set:		FWTtweaksDate:			2 November 1998Author:			Dan IngallsA couple of comment fixes to my wavelet transform."!!FWT commentStamp: 'di 11/2/1998 14:23' prior: 0!This class implements the Fast Wavelet Transform.  It follows Mac Cody's article in Dr. Dobb's Journal, April 1992.  See also... 	http://www.dfw.net/~mcody/fwt/fwt.htmlNotable features of his implementation include...1.  The ability to generate a large family of wavelets (including the Haar (alpha=beta) and Daubechies) from two parameters, alpha and beta, which range between -pi and pi.2.  All data arrays have 5 elements added on to allow for convolution overrun with filters up to 6 in length (the max for this implementation).3.  After a forward transform, the detail coefficients of the deomposition are found in transform at: 2*i, for i = 1, 2, ... nLevels;  and the approximation coefficients are in transform at: (2*nLevels-1).  these together comprise the complete wavelet transform.The following changes from cody's listings should also be noted...1.  The three DotProduct routines have been merged into one.2.  The four routines WaveletDecomposition, DecomposeBranches, WaveletReconstruction, ReconstructBranches have all been merged into transformForward:.3.  All indexing follows the Smalltalk 1-to-N convention, naturally.!!FWT methodsFor: 'testing' stamp: 'di 10/31/1998 22:17'!viewPhiAndPsi  "(FWT new nSamples: 256 nLevels: 6) viewPhiAndPsi"	"View the scaling function and mother wavelets for this transform"	| p |	Display fillWhite: (0@0 extent: 300@300).	Display border: (0@0 extent: 300@300) width: 2.	[Sensor anyButtonPressed] whileFalse:		["Move mouse around in the outer rectangle to explore"		p _ Sensor cursorPoint min: 300@300.		self setAlpha: (p x - 150) / 150.0 * Float pi				beta: (p y - 150) / 150.0 * Float pi.		'alpha=', (alpha roundTo: 0.01) printString, '   ',			'beta=', (beta roundTo: 0.01) printString, '    ' displayAt: 50@5.		transform do: [:w | w atAllPut: 0.0].		(transform at: transform size - 1) at: (nSamples>>nLevels) put: 1.0.		self transformForward: false.		FFT new plot: (samples copyFrom: 1 to: nSamples) in: (20@30 extent: nSamples@100).		transform do: [:w | w atAllPut: 0.0].		(transform at: transform size) at: (nSamples>>nLevels) put: 1.0.		self transformForward: false.		FFT new plot: (samples copyFrom: 1 to: nSamples) in: (20@170 extent: nSamples@100)].	Sensor waitNoButton! !
