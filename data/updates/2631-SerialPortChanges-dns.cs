If the port is in use elsewhere, trying to open it gets a Primitive Error.I'd rather have my code get back some indication that the port didn't open, so I made some small mods to SerialPort, which are attached. Basically, primitives used during open answer nil if they fail, and the open method answers nil also.Dave"!!SerialPort methodsFor: 'open/close' stamp: 'dns 6/27/2000 19:49'!openPort: portNumber	"Open the given serial port, using the settings specified by my instance variables.
