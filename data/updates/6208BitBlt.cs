'From Squeak3.8alpha of ''17 July 2004'' [latest update: #5989] on 16 September 2004 at 7:30:55 pm'!"Change Set:		BitBltDate:			16 September 2004Author:			KarlHi,I got Squeak to freeze when I run Balloon3D in a combinationof the autoAccessor Preference and direct hardware accelearationusing Squeak3.7Gamma#5983 updated with to a FullImage to get Balloon3D. The problem is B3DHardwareEngine>>restoreMorphicForeground:above:which sends #halftoneForm: to a BitBlt instance. But there is noaccessor method with this name.To reproduce:1. disable the squeak preference for autoAccessors2. Evaluate 'B3DSceneExplorerMorph new openInWorld'3. select 'Enable hardware accelaration' in the morph4. Try to open a halo on the morphIt can easily be fixed if the accessor #halftoneForm: is added to BitBlt (additionally adding #halftoneForm for consistency). I would vote for adding this fix to the basic Squeak image even if it currently onlyaffects Balloon3D and my be packaged with it.ByeTorsten"!!BitBlt methodsFor: 'accessing' stamp: 'tbn 9/14/2004 20:38'!halftoneForm	"Returns the receivers half tone form.
