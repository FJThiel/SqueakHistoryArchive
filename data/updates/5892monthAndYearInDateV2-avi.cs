'From Squeak3.7alpha of 11 September 2003 [latest update: #5707] on 29 February 2004 at 1:21:46 pm'!"Change Set:		monthAndYearInDate-aviDate:			21 February 2004Author:			Avi BryantV2: I was wrong about #year, so it's been removed from the CS.  #monthIndex, which was broken by this changeset, is now fixed.The Date class, though not part of the ANSI standard, is given ANSI semantics for #month and #year by the Chronology package, which has them return numeric values.  This breaks backwards compatibility with Squeak code that expects them to return Month and Year objects respectively.  This changeset restores these methods to their original behaviors (while keeping the ANSI standard behavior for the ANSI DateAndTime class)."!!Date methodsFor: 'squeak protocol' stamp: 'avi 2/21/2004 18:12'!month	^ self asMonth! !!Date methodsFor: 'squeak protocol' stamp: 'avi 2/29/2004 13:10'!monthIndex	^ super month! !
