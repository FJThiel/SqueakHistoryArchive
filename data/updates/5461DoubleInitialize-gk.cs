As far as I can see the call 'self initialize' is not needed here, the method is only called from the class side which has already done a call to 'super new' which in class Morph calls #initialize.Browser and some other tools use this class and after the fix the double initialization went away. And the tools still work. :)"!!PluggableButtonMorph methodsFor: 'initialize-release' stamp: 'gk 9/22/2003 09:10'!on: anObject getState: getStateSel action: actionSel label: labelSel menu: menuSel	self model: anObject.	getStateSelector _ getStateSel.	actionSelector _ actionSel.	getLabelSelector _ labelSel.	getMenuSelector _ menuSel.	self update: labelSel.! !
