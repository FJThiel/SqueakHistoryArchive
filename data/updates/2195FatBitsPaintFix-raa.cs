I explored it, selected it, wrote self bitEdit, and then when I inspect it it has a depth of 32.Bob: I see. The 32-bit depth in FatBitsPaint was a change I made since some operations were not working at lower depths. I think you can safely remove the depth test in #accept (included below) and things will work as you expect. I was able to complete your test and see the changes in the ColorPicker."!!FatBitsPaint methodsFor: 'menu' stamp: 'RAA 5/14/2000 12:42'!accept	| f |	f _ self unmagnifiedForm.	f boundingBox = formToEdit boundingBox		ifFalse: [^ self error: 'implementation error; form dimensions should match'].	f displayOn: formToEdit.
