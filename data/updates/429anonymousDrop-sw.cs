'From Squeak 2.2 of Sept 23, 1998 on 23 November 1998 at 9:39:45 am'!"Change Set:		anonymousDrop-swDate:			23 November 1998Author:			Scott WallaceFixes a bug (when running a morphic world in an mvc project) and amends a related 'feature' (when running in a morphic project) wherein if you dropped a phrase tile from a viewer that was open for a non-flagship instance of a uniclass, you would get a puzzling error message, which, in the morphic-project case, could be irrecoverable.  The fix is just to drop the naked phrase onto the receptor rather than engage in any confusing dialogue."!!Player methodsFor: 'scripts-kernel' stamp: 'sw 11/19/1998 12:33'!anonymousScriptEditorFor: aPhraseTileMorph	| aScriptEditor aUserScript |	self isFlagshipForClass ifFalse:		[^ aPhraseTileMorph].	aUserScript _ self class anonymousUserScriptFor: self unusedScriptName player: self.	aScriptEditor _ aUserScript instantiatedScriptEditor.	aPhraseTileMorph		ifNotNil:			[aScriptEditor scriptName: aUserScript selector phrase: aPhraseTileMorph]		ifNil:			[aScriptEditor startOutEmptyForScriptName: aUserScript selector].	^ aScriptEditor! !
