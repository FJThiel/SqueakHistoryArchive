This makes it easy to fire a script precisely once by just quickly hitting the try-me button.Also, the delay logic associated the 'step' button (in a complex of oval stop-step-go buttons) is improved so that the delay is made a function of how long the step took (formerly, a static 200ms delay had been issued after every step, no matter how long it took to process the step.)" !!Presenter methodsFor: 'stop-step-go buttons' stamp: 'sw 5/18/2000 09:31'!stepStillDown: dummy with: theButton	| now dt |	now _ Time millisecondClockValue.	(stepButton == nil or: [stepButton isInWorld not]) ifTrue: [stepButton _ theButton].	self stepButtonState: true.	self stopButtonState: false.	associatedMorph stepAll.	associatedMorph world displayWorld.	dt _ Time millisecondClockValue - now max: 0.
