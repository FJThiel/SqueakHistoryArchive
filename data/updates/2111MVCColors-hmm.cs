BitBlt calls this method to convert colors into Bitmaps. The resulting Bitmap may be multiple words to represent a stipple pattern of several lines.  "	"See also:	pixelValueAtDepth:	-- value for single pixel				pixelWordAtDepth:	-- a 32-bit word filled with the pixel value"	"Details: The pattern for the most recently requested depth is cached."	"Note for depths > 2, there are stippled and non-stippled versions (generated with #balancedPatternForDepth: and #bitPatternForDepth:, respectively). The stippled versions don't work with the window bit caching of StandardSystemView, so we make sure that for these depths, only unstippled patterns are returned"	(depth == cachedDepth and: [depth <= 2 or: [cachedBitPattern size = 1]]) ifTrue: [^ cachedBitPattern].	cachedDepth _ depth.	depth > 2 ifTrue: [^ cachedBitPattern _ Bitmap with: (self pixelWordForDepth: depth)].	depth = 1 ifTrue: [^ cachedBitPattern _ self halfTonePattern1].	depth = 2 ifTrue: [^ cachedBitPattern _ self halfTonePattern2].! !
