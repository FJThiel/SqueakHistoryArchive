On the macintosh in a 3.x VM  you can  turn the power manager on or off. This may make your iBook run faster, and will prevents your macintosh from sleeping. This does consume more power so your battery life will be degraded. Usually you can turn processor cycling off in the control panel, but this class ensures it's off if you set the preference to turn power management off!!PowerManagement class methodsFor: 'startup logic' stamp: 'JMM 2/2/2001 13:10'!deinstall	"PowerManagement deinstall"	Smalltalk removeFromStartUpList: self.! !!PowerManagement class methodsFor: 'startup logic' stamp: 'JMM 2/2/2001 13:26'!startUp	[Preferences turnOffPowerManager		ifTrue: [Smalltalk disablePowerManager]] ifError: []! !!PowerManagement class methodsFor: 'class initialization' stamp: 'JMM 2/2/2001 13:09'!initialize	"PowerManagement initialize"	Smalltalk addToStartUpList: self! !PowerManagement initialize!"Postscript:Add Preference for Power Manager."Preferences	addPreference: #turnOffPowerManager	category: #performance	default:  false	balloonHelp: 'May offer higer performance at the expense of the life of your Battery (macintosh only in 3.VM)'. PowerManagement initialize.!
