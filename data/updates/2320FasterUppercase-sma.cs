One could even get additional 20% by open-coding the collect method but I think shorter is better here.  If you need a really fast implmentation, do it like #asLowercase which is still 45 times (!!) faster."!!String methodsFor: 'converting' stamp: 'sma 6/12/2000 11:40'!asLowercase	"Answer a String made up from the receiver whose characters are all 	lowercase."	^ self copy asString translateToLowercase! !!String methodsFor: 'converting' stamp: 'sma 6/12/2000 11:41'!asUppercase	"Answer a String made up from the receiver whose characters are all 	uppercase."	^ self collect: [:each | each asUppercase]! !
