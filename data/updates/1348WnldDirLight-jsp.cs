I either forgot to add this variable or it disappeared along the way, but in either case it was causing direction to show up in Undeclared.  This change set fixes that."!WonderlandLightSource subclass: #WonderlandDirectionalLight	instanceVariableNames: 'direction '	classVariableNames: ''	poolDictionaries: ''	category: 'Wonderland-Lights'!!WonderlandDirectionalLight class methodsFor: 'change logging' stamp: 'jsp 7/25/1999 23:26'!acceptsLoggingOfCompilation	^ self == WonderlandDirectionalLight.! !!WonderlandDirectionalLight class methodsFor: 'change logging' stamp: 'jsp 7/25/1999 23:26'!wantsChangeSetLogging	^ self == WonderlandDirectionalLight.! !
