'From Squeak3.2alpha of 3 October 2001 [latest update: #4604] on 13 December 2001 at 12:48:38 am'!"Change Set:		outOfUES-swDate:			12 December 2001Author:			Scott WallaceCaution: standalone and plugin images require different versions of this.Two items inspired by recent activity at UES(1)  Because of intractable performance problems, the isOverColor test is made unavailable.  This REALLY slowed things down in a Viewer open to the tests category.(2)  Makes the do-it receiver in a textual scriptor be the same as the 'self' referred to in the code; thus, one can evaluate Smalltalk expressions inside a scriptor and have the right 'self' pertain."!!MethodHolder methodsFor: 'menu' stamp: 'sw 12/12/2001 21:27'!doItReceiver	"If there is an instance associated with me, answer it, for true mapping of self.
