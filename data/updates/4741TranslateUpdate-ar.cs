In other words, the pluginFlag is not needed and not supported."	"Translate the Smalltalk description of the virtual machine into C. If inlineFlag is true,small method bodies are inlined to reduce procedure call overhead. On the PPC, this results in a factor of three speedup with only 30% increase in code size.
