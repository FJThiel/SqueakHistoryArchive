It would seem to have much the same trouble since even more of the instvars will not be set."!!BitmapFillStyle class methodsFor: 'instance creation' stamp: 'KLC 1/27/2004 13:33'!fromForm: aForm	| fs |	fs _ self form: aForm.	fs origin: 0@0.	fs direction: aForm width @ 0.	fs normal: 0 @ aForm height.	fs tileFlag: true.	^fs! !
