It is a great place to execute top-level commands to compute something useful, and it is a great place to develop bits of a program before those bits get put into class methods.To open a new workspace, execute:	Workspace openA workspace can have its own variables, called "workspace variables", to hold intermediate results.  For example, if you type into a workspace "x := 5" and do-it, then later you could type in "y := x * 2" and y would become 10.Additionally, in Morphic, a workspace can gain access to morphs that are on the screen.  If acceptDroppedMorphss is turned on, then whenever a morph is dropped on the workspace, a variable will be created which references that morph.  This functionality is toggled with the window-wide menu of a workspace.The instance variables of this class are:	bindings  -  holds the workspace variables for this workspace	acceptDroppedMorphss - whether dropped morphs should create new variables!]style[(286 14 722)f1,f1dWorkspace open;;,f1!
