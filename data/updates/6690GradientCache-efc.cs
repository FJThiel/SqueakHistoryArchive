If false, it is a linear gradient.	isTranslucent	<Boolean>	A (cached) flag determining if there are any translucent colors involved.Class variables:	PixelRampCache <LRUCache>	Recently used pixelRamps. They tend to have high temporal locality and this saves space and time.!"Zap the pixelRamp caches for all existing GradientFillStyle instances. This will force them to go through the new cache the next time a pixelramp is required. This reuse saved about 300k in my image."GradientFillStyle allInstancesDo:[:each| each pixelRamp: nil ]!
