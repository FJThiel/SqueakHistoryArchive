Secondly, with flaps open, Morphs showed 'innocuous' names ending in digits because thumbnails had 'known' names from their representees. The postscriptum nils all names in existing thumbnails (new thumbnails shouldn't get one)."!!MorphThumbnail methodsFor: 'all' stamp: 'bf 3/31/1999 12:24'!innocuousName	^ morphRepresented isNil		ifTrue: [super innocuousName]		ifFalse: [morphRepresented innocuousName]! !!MorphThumbnail methodsFor: 'all' stamp: 'bf 3/31/1999 12:38'!morphRepresented: aMorph	morphRepresented _ aMorph.	self computeThumbnail.! !!MorphThumbnail methodsFor: 'all' stamp: 'bf 3/31/1999 07:54'!representativeNoTallerThan: maxHeight norWiderThan: maxWidth thumbnailHeight: thumbnailHeight	"Return a morph representing the receiver but which is no taller than aHeight.
