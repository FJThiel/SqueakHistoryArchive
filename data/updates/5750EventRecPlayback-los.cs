Leaving out the call to 'rewind' seems to work fine (also plausible, considering that the tape has just been read in from the file).The attached change set contains a corresponding patch.Regards, Lothar"!!EventRecorderMorph class methodsFor: 'instance creation' stamp: 'los 2/26/2004 11:46'!openTapeFromFile: fullName	"Open an eventRecorder tape for playback." 	(self new) readTape: fullName; openInWorld! !
