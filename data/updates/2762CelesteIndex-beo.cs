'From Squeak2.8 of 13 June 2000 [latest update: #2345] on 25 June 2000 at 9:45:33 pm'!"Change Set:		CelesteIndexDate:			25 June 2000Author:			Bruce O'Neel  On the mac the EMAIL.index.log file behaves a bit incorrectly.  Firstit stays around after Celeste is closed, and second if you close Celesteand then open Celeste again quickly, before a GC, the file is stillopen and the mac gets indigestion when you try to open a file whichis open.  This change set just makes sure the indexlog is closed."!!IndexFile methodsFor: 'read-write' stamp: 'BEO 6/25/2000 15:36'!save	| dir shortName |	super save. 	self logStream close.	shortName _ FileDirectory localNameFor: filename.	dir _ FileDirectory forFileName: filename.	dir deleteFileNamed: shortName , '.log' ifAbsent: []! !
