To reestablish the former keyboard-focus policy, set the mouseOverForKeyboardFocus preference to true."Preferences addPreference: #mouseOverForKeyboardFocus categories: #(morphic) default: false  balloonHelp: 'When true, the mouse must be over a text or list pane in morphic for keystrokes to be felt, and when the mouse is out over the desktop, the so-called desktop-command-keys, such as cmd-b and cmd-R, are honored.  When false, list panes and text panes in morphic remain sensitive to keystrokes even after the mouse is no longer over the pane.'.!!PluggableListMorph methodsFor: 'events' stamp: 'sw 12/4/2001 12:41'!mouseLeave: event	"The mouse has left the area of the receiver"	super mouseLeave: event.	Preferences mouseOverForKeyboardFocus ifTrue:		[event hand releaseKeyboardFocus: self]! !!PluggableTextMorph methodsFor: 'pane events' stamp: 'sw 12/4/2001 12:42'!mouseLeave: event	"The mouse has left the area of the receiver"	textMorph ifNotNil: [selectionInterval _ textMorph editor selectionInterval].	super mouseLeave: event.	Preferences mouseOverForKeyboardFocus ifTrue:		[event hand releaseKeyboardFocus: textMorph]! !
