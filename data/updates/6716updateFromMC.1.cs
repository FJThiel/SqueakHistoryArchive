Seems to break nothing.	----	Change Set:		selectorsWithArgs-md	Date:			2 January 2006	Author:			Marcus Denker	Make Behavior>>#selectorsWithArgs: use symbol>>#numArgs.	Much simpler: one line. And it fixes a bug.	----	Change Set:		removeUndefTest	Date:			14 January 2006	Author:			Marcus Denker	removes UndefinedObject>>#test, which was a test method for alternate syntax	-----	0002373: ParagraphEditor >> #makeCapitalized: comment is not correct	-----	Change Set:		SysWindowClean01-wiz	Date:			18 January 2006	Author:			(wiz) Jerome Peace	wiz 1/18/2006 15:34	Ok. I think that does it.	Removed unused preference and SystemWindow methods that use it Mantis # 2532.	------	Change Set:		decompileBlock-md	Date:			24 November 2005	Author:			Marcus Denker	A  simplification for BlockContext>>decompileBlock:	The Method got the tempNames by compiling the source of the method. This	is already implemented in methodNode tempNames... thus not needed here.	------	remove emptycheck for Heap>>fist and SequencableCollection	#first, #last, #middle	------	0002514: [FIX] condenseSources (was: Re: [Q] Removing changes file content.	------	Delay startTimerInterruptWatcher	to fix	0002379: BlockContext>>decompile broken, ProcessBrowser does not work	------	0002377: Cannot rename a project from its window menu	0002497: MNU when changing title on Morphic Project	0002415: Error after one presses ESC key two times.	0002145: KlattFrame: ZeroDivide exception when the value of ro, rk or ra is 0	-----	Change Set:		FileListCodeDNUfix-efc	Author:			Eddie Cottongim	Apparently Object got (errantly?) registered with FileList as a file reader. This was throwing 	some DNUs. This simple doit unregisters Object and appears to solve the problem.	-----	Change Set:		RemoveAlternateSynPref	-----	Change Set:		PlusToolsAlternateSyntaxFix	Date:			14 January 2006	Author:			Marcus Denker	The horrible alternateSyntax hack has been removed in 3.9. This fixes	three methods in the plustools to not use definitionST80: but definitionST80	------"!"Postscript:Leave the line above, and replace the rest of this comment by a useful one.Executable statements should follow this comment, and shouldbe separated by periods, with no exclamation points (!!).Be sure to put any further comments in double-quotes, like this one."|repository|repository := MCHttpRepository                location: 'http://source.squeakfoundation.org/39a'                user: ''                password: ''.(repository loadVersionFromFileNamed: 'ScriptLoader-md.87.mcz') load.ScriptLoader new updateFrom6716!
