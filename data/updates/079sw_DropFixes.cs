Comparable bulletproofing is also added to PasteUpMorph, to avoid the phenomenon of objects being dropped 'successfully' but not being visible on the page after drop -- which could happen in drops on a page of a book in a tabbed complex, for example."!!BookMorph methodsFor: 'dropping/grabbing' stamp: 'sw 5/31/1998 00:04'!wantsDroppedMorph: aMorph event: evt	(currentPage bounds containsPoint: evt cursorPoint) ifFalse: [^ false].	^ super wantsDroppedMorph: aMorph event: evt! !!PasteUpMorph methodsFor: 'dropping/grabbing' stamp: 'sw 5/31/1998 00:21'!wantsDroppedMorph: aMorph event: evt	^ (self openToDragNDrop and: [self isPartsBin not]) and: [self bounds containsPoint: evt cursorPoint]! !
