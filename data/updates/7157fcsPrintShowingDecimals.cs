'From Squeak3.10beta of 22 July 2007 [latest update: #7156] on 24 November 2007 at 7:17:45 am'!"Reporter: franksergeantSummary: 0005640: additional tests and fixes for Number>>printShowingDecimalPlaces:Description: I noticed three problems with Number>>printShowingDecimalPlaces: 1. the leading minus sign was missing for negative numbers between 0 and -1, 2. rounding was screwy for both negative and positive numbers, 3. the category of the method is 'converting' but should be 'printing'.    I have added several tests to NumberTest>>testPrintShowingDecimalPlaces toillustrate the problems.  I included a test for the category in thetests and changed the category from 'converting' to 'printing' (butleft it commented out?  Feel free to email me to explain what I should havedone if different -- frank@pygmy.utoh.org. />Then, I modified Number>>printShowingDecimalPlaces: so the old and the new tests of NumberTest pass.Additional Information: In particular,      -0.98 printShowingDecimalPlaces: 2fails to show the minus sign, and     2.567 printShowingDecimalPlaces: 2answers '2.56' but should answer '2.57'.The new version of #printShowingDecimalPlaces attached fixes those problems and still passes the other NumberTest tests. "!"To follow this seehttp://bugs.squeak.org/view.php?id= 5640"ReleaseBuilderFor3dot10 new updatePackages: 'Kernel-edc.171(170).mcdKernelTests-edc.62(61).mcd'!
