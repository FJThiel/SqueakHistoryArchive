'From Squeak3.10beta of 22 July 2007 [latest update: #7155] on 23 November 2007 at 6:40:15 am'!"Reporter: gokrSummary: 0004669: [ENH] TimeForSpeedDescription: Ok, so we were trying to figure out why our logger in Gjallar spent so much time in creating DateAndTime etc... after looking, tweaking, profiling and even some thinking I came up with this <SpeedPack> of changes.I might have broken some subtleties (I don't think I have though) but the tests are still green. Glad for any indepth review.And? Well, the speed differences are quite huge. :) Lots of it comes from better Duration instance creation methods and from not going back and forth too much between nanos and seconds etc.<DateAndTime now> is about 6 times faster and "Date today" 4 times. The full chronology test suite runs almost 2 times faster. See preamble for a do-it that shows this (run before and after installing cs).So far only tested in 3.8.Additional Information: "!"To follow this seehttp://bugs.squeak.org/view.php?id= 4669"ReleaseBuilderFor3dot10 new loadTogether: #('Kernel-edc.170.mcz' ) merge: false.ReleaseBuilderFor3dot10 new loadTogether: #('KernelTests-edc.61.mcz' ) merge: false.!
