Just paint a zig-zag line, rotate it, and you can grab it even by clicking in between the zig-zags.  This surely breaks the illusion of the 'thingness' of self-painted objects.  Fix by removing a fullBounds send in TransformMorph>>containsPoint:."!!TransformMorph methodsFor: 'geometry' stamp: 'bf 9/11/2001 23:29'!containsPoint: aPoint	(bounds containsPoint: aPoint) ifFalse: [^ false].	self hasSubmorphs		ifTrue: [self submorphsDo: 					[:m | (m containsPoint: (transform globalPointToLocal: aPoint))							ifTrue: [^ true]].				^ false]		ifFalse: [^ true]! !
