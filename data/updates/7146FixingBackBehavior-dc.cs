'From Squeak3.10beta of 22 July 2007 [latest update: #7145] on 4 November 2007 at 8:30:48 am'!"Reporter: Damien CassouSummary: 0006583: PositionableStream>>back behavior is totally wrongDescription: The current method #back is a misconception about what a stream is. A stream contains a pointer *between* elements with past and future elements. This method considers that the pointer is *on* an element.Attached changeset:- renames #back to #oldBack for backward compatibility- implements #back- adds 4 tests.Please consider unit tests in the changeset which verifies #back and #oldBack behavior.Additional Information: "!"To follow this seehttp://bugs.squeak.org/view.php?id= 6583"ReleaseBuilderFor3dot10 new loadTogether: (Array with:'Collections-edc.90.mcz' with:'CollectionsTests-edc.74.mcz') merge: false.!
