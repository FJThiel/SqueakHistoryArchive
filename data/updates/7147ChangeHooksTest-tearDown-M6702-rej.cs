'From Squeak3.10beta of 22 July 2007 [latest update: #7148] on 6 October 2007 at 7:40:40 am'!"Reporter: RalphJohnsonSummary: 0006702: ChangeHooksTest has a bugDescription: Running ChangehooksTest causes a notified to pop up for each test method.  The notifier is caused by tearing down the test, because it tries to restore the old change set but fails.  It tried to set the current change set with a message to ChangeOrganization, but it should have sent it to ChangeSet.  I have a patch that fixes the test.Additional Information: "!"To follow this seehttp://bugs.squeak.org/view.php?id= 6702"ReleaseBuilderFor3dot10 new loadTogether: #('SystemChangeNotification-Tests-edc.10.mcz' ) merge: false.!
