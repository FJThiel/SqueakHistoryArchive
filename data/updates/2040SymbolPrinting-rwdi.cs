'From Squeak2.8alpha of 12 January 2000 [latest update: #2039] on 25 April 2000 at 12:45:45 pm'!"Change Set:		SymbolPrintingDate:			25 April 2000Author:			Roel Wuyts, Dan IngallsThis changeSet incorporates Roel Wuyts's suggested change to print symbols with a #-sign in their printString.It also uses the #'any chars' construct to ensure that any symbol can be printed as a literal.  NOTE:  This implies a change in the definition of Symbol>>isLiteral to always return true (it used only to return true for symbols that can be printed without string quotes as #someSymbol).  If you really want to test whether a symbol can be printed without string quotes, then use the expression (Scanner isLiteralSymbol: theSymbol)."!!ChangeSorter methodsFor: 'message list' stamp: 'di 4/25/2000 10:33'!messageList 	| probe newSelectors |	currentClassName ifNil: [^ #()].	probe _ (currentClassName endsWith: ' class')		ifTrue: [currentClassName]		ifFalse: [currentClassName asSymbol].	newSelectors _ myChangeSet selectorsInClass: probe.	(newSelectors includes: currentSelector) ifFalse: [currentSelector _ nil].	^ newSelectors asSortedCollection! !!Symbol methodsFor: 'printing' stamp: 'rw 4/6/2000 10:41'!printOn: aStream	self storeOn: aStream! !!Symbol methodsFor: 'printing' stamp: 'di 4/25/2000 12:32'!storeOn: aStream 	aStream nextPut: $#.	(Scanner isLiteralSymbol: self)		ifTrue: [aStream nextPutAll: self]		ifFalse: [super storeOn: aStream]! !!Symbol methodsFor: 'testing' stamp: 'di 4/25/2000 12:32'!isLiteral	"Answer whether the receiver is a valid Smalltalk literal."	^ true! !
