"Change Set:		scamperBookmark-lsDate:			19 January 2001Author:			Lex SpoonThe new support for bookmarks in Scamper leaves Bookmark undefined.  This changeset reverts the one method which accesses Bookmark, just so that Squeak doesn't have any undefined references any longer.  A better fix would be to make it actually work right, but that is beyond me!!  -lex"!!Scamper class methodsFor: 'instance creation' stamp: 'sma 4/30/2000 11:49'!openOnUrl: aStringOrUrl	"Open Scamper browser on specified url.		Scamper openOnUrl: 'www.squeak.org'		Scamper openOnUrl: 'file://C%3A/test.htm'	"	^ self new		jumpToUrl: aStringOrUrl asUrl;		openAsMorph! !
