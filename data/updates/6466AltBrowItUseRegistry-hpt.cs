'From Squeak3.8alpha of 8 September 2004 [latest update: #6290] on 2 October 2004 at 2:30:17 pm'!"Change Set:		AltBrowItUseRegistry-hptDate:			2 October 2004Author:			Hernan TylimThis .cs changes the way the preference #alternativeBrowseIt works.From this preference help #alternativeBrowseIt is supposed to bring up a menu of matching class names when hitting ALT+B to open a browser on the selected one.The bug that this cs fixes is the browser which is used. The preference help doesn't say anything about changing the browser, but it does, it uses the Hierarchy Browser, not the common one used with ALT+B. So this changeset fixes that.The reason why this fix is important is because in this way #alternativeBrowseIt will use the SystemBrowser registry and not a hardcoded browser. If someone wants a Hierarchy Browser then it can be registered at the registry."!!ParagraphEditor methodsFor: 'menu messages' stamp: 'hpt 10/2/2004 14:17'!browseClassFromIt	"Launch a hierarchy browser for the class indicated by the	current selection.
