'From Squeak3.10beta of 22 July 2007 [latest update: #7143] on 4 November 2007 at 7:54:52 am'!"Reporter: andreasSummary: 0006576: Delay is not thread-safeDescription: Delay is not thread-safe since currently the calling process updates the internal Delay structure itself. If the process gets terminated while doing this (e.g., adding/removing from SuspendedDelays) the whole system is left in an inconsistent state and breaks. Attached changes fix the problem.Additional Information: It is *very* hard to recreate this problem under controlled circumstances which is the reason why there are no tests accompanying the changes. I've not been able to create the problem on a single machine but we have seen it for months on our servers and with these changes the problem simply went away."!"To follow this seehttp://bugs.squeak.org/view.php?id= 6576"ReleaseBuilderFor3dot10 new loadTogether: (Array with:'Kernel-edc.167.mcz' with:'System-edc.106.mcz') merge: false.!
