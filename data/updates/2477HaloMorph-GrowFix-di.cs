This is not the right thing to do if that corner is off the edge of the screen.This change applies no offset when the bottomRight corner is off the screen."!!HaloMorph methodsFor: 'private' stamp: 'di 8/7/2000 23:48'!startGrow: evt with: growHandle	| botRt |	"Initialize resizing of my target."	growingOrRotating _ true.	self removeAllHandlesBut: growHandle.
