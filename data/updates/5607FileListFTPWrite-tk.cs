For years now, editing a file and writing it back to the server has been broken.  (Why didn't anyone complain?)  Dan finally did complain, and the problem was that the close message in RemoteFileStream was calling itself recursively.  With this fix, files on remote servers can be edited in a FileList."!!RemoteFileStream methodsFor: 'as yet unclassified' stamp: 'tk 12/3/2003 21:04'!close	"Write if we have data to write.
