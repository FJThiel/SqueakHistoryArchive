'From Squeak2.8alpha of 4 February 2000 [latest update: #1919] on 15 March 2000 at 10:58:09 pm'!"Change Set:		14LabelDraggin-smaDate:			15 March 2000Author:			Stefan Matthias AustLeandro Caniglia suggested a fix to disable the #relabel function, that is you can normally drag a window if you click on the window's label.  This was already implemented for Morphic by Scott Wallace, so I took the opportunity and implemented the same for MVC.Use 'Preferences clickOnLabelToEdit' to toggle the behavior.  If you shift-click, you still get the old (relabel) behavior."!!StandardSystemController methodsFor: 'control defaults' stamp: 'sma 3/15/2000 22:19'!redButtonActivity	"If cursor is in label of a window when red button is pushed,	check for closeBox or growBox, else drag the window frame	or edit the label."	| box p |	p _ sensor cursorPoint.	self labelHasCursor ifFalse: [super redButtonActivity. ^ self].	((box _ view closeBoxFrame) containsPoint: p)		ifTrue:			[Utilities				awaitMouseUpIn: box				repeating: []				ifSucceed: [self close. ^ self].			^ self].	((box _ view growBoxFrame) containsPoint: p)		ifTrue:			[Utilities				awaitMouseUpIn: box				repeating: []				ifSucceed:					[Sensor controlKeyPressed ifTrue: [^ self expand; fullScreen].					^ view isCollapsed						ifTrue: [self expand]						ifFalse: [self collapse]].			^ self].	(((box _ view labelTextRegion expandBy: 1) containsPoint: p)			and: [Preferences clickOnLabelToEdit or: [sensor leftShiftDown]])		ifTrue:			[Utilities				awaitMouseUpIn: box				repeating: []				ifSucceed: [^ self label].			^ self].	self move! !
