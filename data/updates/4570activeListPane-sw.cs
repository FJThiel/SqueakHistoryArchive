Puts up mild border feedback when a pluggable-list-morph has the keyboard focus.  The color used is the same as the text-highlight color; this establishes a modicum of consistency: when a *text* pane of a window has the keyboard focus, the feedback is the text-highlighting in that same text-highlight color.  This is an experimental add-on to Dan's lazyKeyboardFocus experiment, attempting to work around the problem that whenever the keyboard focus lazily remained in a list pane after the mouse left the pane, there was no user feedback designating which list pane would receive keystrokes -- sometimes a serious problem because the same command-key can mean radically different things depending on which pane gets the command."!!PluggableListMorph methodsFor: 'drawing' stamp: 'sw 12/1/2001 16:40'!drawOn: aCanvas	"Draw the list on the canvas, and possibly also draw frame feedback"	| colorToFillWith areaToFill next |	super drawOn: aCanvas.	self hasFocus ifTrue:		[aCanvas frameRectangle: scroller bounds color: Preferences textHighlightColor].	selectedMorph ifNil: [^self].	colorToFillWith _ color.	next _ self.	[colorToFillWith isTransparent and: [(next _ next owner) notNil]] whileTrue: [		colorToFillWith _ next color.	].	colorToFillWith _ colorToFillWith luminance < 0.5 ifTrue: [		colorToFillWith muchLighter	] ifFalse: [		colorToFillWith darker	].	areaToFill _ ((scroller transformFrom: self) localBoundsToGlobal: selectedMorph bounds)					intersect: scroller bounds.	aCanvas fillRectangle: areaToFill color: colorToFillWith! !!PluggableListMorph methodsFor: 'events' stamp: 'sw 12/1/2001 16:53'!keyboardFocusChange: aBoolean	"The message is sent to a morph when its keyboard focus change.
