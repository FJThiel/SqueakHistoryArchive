'From Squeak3.3alpha of 18 January 2002 [latest update: #4965] on 4 September 2002 at 4:53:29 pm'!"Change Set:		fromAppleHill-swDate:			4 September 2002Author:			Scott WallaceThree issues that arose in the company of Kim and BJ at Apple Hill:(1)  Newly drawn sketches sometimes did not show up in the playerlist of the Presenter (because its playerList cache was not getting invalidated;) thus their names would not show up in the script-name popup, and also sometimes they would not get stepped.  This is a bug that actually goes back more than four years.(2)  Launching a PDAMorph in a system that lacked a .sources file, (such as a typical PlugIn image), would raise an error, because PDA.initialize assumed that class comments would always respond to the selector #string, which Texts do but which (perhaps surprisingly) Strings themselves do not.(3)  For the Squeakland image, make four custom preference adjustments.This update is intended to apply both to 3.3a and the Squeakland plug-in update streams; the preference changes will only be felt in Squeakland"!!PDA methodsFor: 'example' stamp: 'sw 8/28/2002 23:12'!sampleNotes	^ {	PDARecord new key: 'home'; description: 'sprinkler schedule'.	PDARecord new key: 'home'; description: 'directions to our houseTake the expressway, #93 southThen south on Rte 24East at the T with 195Take exit 12 and go right to Faunce CornerCross rte 6, continue on Old Westport Rdtakes a bend left and becomes Chase RdContinue for 3.5-4 miRt at T intersection on Russell Mills RdPass DPW on leftLg Yellow bldg Davall''s storeleft on Rocko Dundee Rddown a swail and up.
