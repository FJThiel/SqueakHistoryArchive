'From Squeak2.8alpha of 4 February 2000 [latest update: #2052] on 30 April 2000 at 5:50:15 pm'!"Change Set:		030FixNewMorphMnu-kfrDate:			1 May 2000Author:			Karl RambergThis fix removes two items from the New Morph menu / Text Support. Neither of the items work alone and so are useless. This just confuses people when trying to add text to a book or something. Use the textMorph in the basic sub menu.--The height of the text component is increased by 10 pixels to make the layout of the different components with inboard scrollmenus easier."!!TextComponent methodsFor: 'as yet unclassified' stamp: 'kfr 5/1/2000 13:51'!initialize	super initialize.	self extent: 144@42! !!TextMorph class methodsFor: 'as yet unclassified' stamp: 'kfr 5/1/2000 13:42'!includeInNewMorphMenu	^ true! !!StringMorphEditor class methodsFor: 'as yet unclassified' stamp: 'kfr 5/1/2000 13:41'!includeInNewMorphMenu	"Not to be instantiated from the menu"	^ false! !!TextMorphForEditView class methodsFor: 'as yet unclassified' stamp: 'kfr 5/1/2000 13:41'!includeInNewMorphMenu	"Not to be instantiated from the menu"	^ false! !
