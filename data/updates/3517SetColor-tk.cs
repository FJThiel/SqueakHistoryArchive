Fixed.  Note these rules:1) If property #fillStyle is absent, the color inst var is the color.2) When #fillStyle is set, color is set to (aFillStyle asColor).  Morph>>color can return this.3) Morph>>color: will clear the #fillStyle property.Removed the color: in PasteUpMorph, since Morph now does the same thing."!!Morph methodsFor: 'accessing' stamp: 'tk 2/15/2001 15:55'!color	^ color 	"has already been set to ((self valueOfProperty: #fillStyle) asColor)"! !!Morph methodsFor: 'accessing' stamp: 'tk 2/15/2001 15:55'!color: aColor	color = aColor ifFalse: [		self removeProperty: #fillStyle.		color _ aColor.		self changed].! !PasteUpMorph removeSelector: #color:!
