The postscript was removed. original comment: Partially replaces KCP-102 since it introduces the pattern new-initialize and does not alter variable objects creation (i.e. definition of #new: remains unchanged). Also, delete all obsolete definitions of new and initialize.This latter task is performed using classes provided by classes of the ObsoleteMethodTest hierarchy, that are removed afterwards (see the postscript)."!!Object methodsFor: 'initialize-release' stamp: 'Noury Bouraqadi 8/23/2003 14:51'!initialize	"Subclasses should redefine this method to perform initializations on instance creation"! !!Behavior methodsFor: 'instance creation' stamp: 'Noury Bouraqadi 8/23/2003 14:51'!new	"Answer a new initialized instance of the receiver (which is a class) with no indexable variables.
