'From Squeak3.7beta of ''1 April 2004'' [latest update: #5969] on 12 July 2004 at 1:12:54 pm'!"Change Set:		RestartTimerInterruptWatcher-nkDate:			12 July 2004Author:			Ned KonzAfter the various class renames in the Chronology updates, there remains a single (non-ChangeRecord) reference to the #ZTime->Time binding. This is in the Delay class timerInterruptWatcher process, which never got restarted properly after the class renames.The result of this is that if you inadvertently try to save a project containing a ChangeSorter it will fail.This change set both clears out the ReadOnlyVariableBindings that have problems, and restarts the timerInterruptWatcher with the new method."( ReadOnlyVariableBinding allInstances	select: [ :ea | ea value isBehavior		and: [ (Smalltalk at: ea key ifAbsent: []) ~~ ea value 			and: [ ea value isObsolete not ] ]])		do: [ :b | [ b value: nil ]				on: AttemptToWriteReadOnlyGlobal				do: [ :ex | ex resume: true ]].Delay shutDown; startTimerInterruptWatcher; startUp.!
