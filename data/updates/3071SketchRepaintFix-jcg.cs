I traced this to the offset of the Sketch's form being added to the origin when the form is first painted on paintedForm.  This appears to fix the problem."!!SketchEditorMorph methodsFor: 'initialization' stamp: 'jcg 11/19/2000 18:00'!initializeFor: aSketchMorph inBounds: boundsToUse pasteUpMorph: aPasteUpMorph paintBoxPosition: aPosition	"NB: if aPosition is nil, then it's assumed that the paintbox is obtained from a flap or some such, so do nothing special regarding a palette in this case.
