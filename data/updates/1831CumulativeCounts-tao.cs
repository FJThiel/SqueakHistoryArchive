The bug is that cumulativeCounts was using truncating divide '//' instead of normal divide '/', causing the reported cumulative percentages to be off (or worse, a division by zero error in some small test cases!!)."!!Bag methodsFor: 'accessing' stamp: 'tao 1/5/2000 18:25'!cumulativeCounts	"Answer with a collection of cumulative percents covered by elements so far."	| s n |	s _ self size / 100.0. n _ 0.	^ self sortedCounts asArray collect:		[:a | n _ n + a key.
