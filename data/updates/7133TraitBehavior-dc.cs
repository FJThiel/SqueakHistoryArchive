This helps tools to work with traits without changing everything.The attached mcz provides:- TraitBehavior>>#allSubclasses- TraitBehavior>>subclasses (pushed up from TraitDescription).Since these methods do not override anything and only returns new arrays without any computation, the fix can be considered safe.Additional Information: "!"To follow this seehttp://bugs.squeak.org/view.php?id= 6575"ReleaseBuilderFor3dot10 new updatePackages: 'Traits-dc.228(edc.227).mcd'!
