It is not clear why this is necessary though - theoretically, any morph should step when it has a player but alas!! something is broken and I have no idea why and where.""14 feb 2001 - bob - I reinstated this after alan noticed that a newly drawn car would not go until you picked it up and dropped it. The reason is that unscripted players have #wantSteps ^false. If a morph enters the world with an unscripted player and then acquires a scripted player, that would be a good time to change, but this will work too"	status == #ticking ifTrue: [		player costume isStepping ifFalse: [player costume arrangeToStartStepping]	].! !
