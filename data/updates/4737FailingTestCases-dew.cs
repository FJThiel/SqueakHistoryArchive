'From Squeak3.2gamma of 30 January 2002 [latest update: #4653] on 3 February 2002 at 1:43:59 am'!"Change Set:		FailingTestCases-dewDate:			3 February 2002Author:			Doug WayDisables the two SUnit tests (#testFailureDebugUI and #testDebugUI) which simply test to make sure the SUnit UI handles failure.  By default, doing a RUN ALL tests in the UI should have all tests pass, so it's silly to have these two purposely fail.  These tests can be re-enabled by uncommenting out the appropriate code.Also removes two recently added tests in FileList2ModalDialogsTest which never worked.After filing this in, doing 'TestRunner runTests' should result in all tests passing, at least in 3.2."!!SUnitTest methodsFor: 'Testing' stamp: 'dew 2/3/2002 01:10'!testDebugUI	"This test has been disabled, so that running all tests will pass.
