'From Squeak3.10beta of 22 July 2007 [latest update: #7144] on 4 November 2007 at 8:18:46 am'!"Reporter: rrSummary: 0006704: Parser proposes to remove temps it can not removeDescription: When accepting a method, if the parser encounters an unused temporaryvariable, it offers to remove it.However half of the time the variable is stored into, and the parser doesnot remove it, instead telling that you should first remove the statementwhere the variable is stored.With this fix (basically reordering the test and the user confirmation) onlythe variables which are truly unused are removed.The code of the method is simpler too.Additional Information: "!"To follow this seehttp://bugs.squeak.org/view.php?id= 6704"ReleaseBuilderFor3dot10 new loadTogether: #('Compiler-edc.62.mcz' ) merge: false.!
