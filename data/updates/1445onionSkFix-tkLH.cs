'From Squeak 2.5 of August 6, 1999 on 15 September 1999 at 10:34:02 am'!"Change Set:		onionSkFix-tkLHDate:			15 September 1999Author:			Ted KaehlerThe update 1443onionSkin-tkLG fixed two odd bugs.  Scott discovered that if you ever get a draw error, a flag is left on, and the transparent onion skin for the paintBox can't be computed.  This clears that flag.  (This update corrects a bug in the fix.)  It also adds 'start drawing again' and 'start stepping again' to the world menu.	1443 also fixed a bug in TTGlyph printOn: when contours is nil"!!SketchEditorMorph methodsFor: 'start & finish' stamp: 'tk 9/15/1999 10:29'!dimTheWindow	"Do not call twice!!
