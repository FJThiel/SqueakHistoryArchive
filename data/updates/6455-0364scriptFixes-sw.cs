This could led to several bizarre effects that could make one doubt ones sanity.*  Flexed morphs were being put on the steplist on the strength of having a player known to their extension.  This was spurious, resulting in pointless extra morphs in the steplist, which sometimes could actually result in unwanted, redundant firings.*  Assign-status-to-all-siblings was not propagating the frequency or the tickingRate to the sibs."!!Morph methodsFor: 'testing' stamp: 'sw 10/24/2004 15:28'!wantsSteps	"Return true if the receiver overrides the default Morph step method."	"Details: Find first class in superclass chain that implements #step and return true if it isn't class Morph."	| c |	self isPartsDonor ifTrue: [^ false].	(self == self topRendererOrSelf) ifTrue: [self player wantsSteps ifTrue: [^ true]].	c _ self class.	[c includesSelector: #step] whileFalse: [c _ c superclass].	^ c ~= Morph! !!ScriptEditorMorph methodsFor: 'initialization' stamp: 'sw 10/24/2004 17:41'!updateToPlayer: newPlayer 	"Make certain that the script name and the names of actors within are up to date"	playerScripted ifNil: 		["likely a naked test/yes/no fragment!!"		^ self].	newPlayer == playerScripted ifTrue: [^ self].
