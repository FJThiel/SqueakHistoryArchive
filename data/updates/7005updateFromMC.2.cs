The problem actually	can happen, and has been observed at Georgia Tech, e.g. if someone	downloads a file but does not complete the download. The current	behavior is that pink debuggers pop up; this is extremely confusing for	new users when it happens in places like the Browser.	The solution in this changeset is to fall back on the decompiler. A	more thorough solution should probably trigger a systematic invalidation	of all source pointers past the end of the changes file, because as time	goes on the changes file will eventually grow large enough to cover the	lost code and the routine will start returning random method code for	the invalid source pointers.	----------------	0001354: MIDI port name is garbled in selection dialog	Change Set:		AddTransMIDIPort	Date:			31 May 2005	Author:			Tooru Nosse		fix for query of MIDI portName with SJIS name	enable translation for midi port selection	----------------	0002341: MorphicEventDispatcher minor refactoring	0001284: Smalltalk condenseSources leads to UndefinedObject(Object)>>error:	0003180: Selector requester does not strip blanks	tests from 0001798: #critical:ifError: on Semaphore does not always signal the semaphore	test from 0003133: [BUG][FIX] Float>>#asIEEE32BitWord and #fromIEEE32Bit:	----------------	Change Set: dupAllCtrlAltKeysPref-dew	Date: 13 December 2004	Author: Doug Way	Adds a new preference duplicateAllCtrlAndAltkeys to duplicate all Ctrl and Alt modifier key 		commands, which causes all Ctrl key commands to behave the same as Alt-key commands. 		The original Ctrl (a.k.a. 'shift') key commands are still available via Ctrl-Shift and Alt-Shift.	This differs from the existing ctrlAlt prefs which only duplicate/swap the eight editing keys. 		Also includes code to prevent these other two conflicting prefs from being activated at the 	same time.	The three related prefs (swapCtrlAndAltKeys, duplicateCtrlAndAltKeys, 		duplicateAllCtrlAndAltKeys) should really be made into a radio button preferences set 	sometime in the future (like the Halo look preferences), since only one can be turned on at 	a time. This would eliminate the need for the #changed methods.	See 'modifier' discussion on squeak-dev from 12/3/2004 for more details on why this was 	provided.	-----------	- postCopy for MethodProperties	- Preferences panel size	- remove Preference #ansiAssignmentOperatorWhenPrettyPrinting	- remove Preference #resizeOnAllSides, #twoSidedPoohTextures	- set selector when evaluating a #Doit.
