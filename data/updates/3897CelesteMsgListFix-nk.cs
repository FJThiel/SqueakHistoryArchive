"Change Set:		CelesteMessageListFix-nkDate:			5 April 2001Author:			Ned KonzApparently ChangeSet 3850 didn't take into accountthe PluggableMultiColumnListMorph, in which abinary search won't work to find the index ofsubmorphs. So here's a version with a linear searchinstead. Not as fast, but at least Celeste doesn't blowup when you access messages by clicking in themessage list."!!PluggableMultiColumnListMorph methodsFor: 'accessing' stamp: 'nk 4/5/2001 23:18'!itemFromPoint: aPoint	"Return the list element (morph) at the given point or nil if outside"	| ptY |	scroller hasSubmorphs ifFalse:[^nil].	(scroller fullBounds containsPoint: aPoint) ifFalse:[^nil].	ptY _ (scroller firstSubmorph point: aPoint from: self) y.	"note: following assumes that submorphs are vertical, non-overlapping, and ordered"	scroller firstSubmorph top > ptY ifTrue:[^nil].	scroller lastSubmorph bottom < ptY ifTrue:[^nil].	"now use binary search"	^scroller submorphThat: [ :item | item top <= ptY and:[item bottom >= ptY] ] ifNone: [].! !
