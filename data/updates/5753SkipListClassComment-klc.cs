Skip lists use probabilistic balancing rather than strictly enforcing balancing and as a result the algorithms for insertion and deletion in skip lists are much simpler and significantly faster than equivalent algorithms for balanced trees."Notes:The elements of the skip list must implement #< or you must provide a sort block.!]style[(83 55 418)f2,f2Rhttp://epaperpress.com/sortsearch/download/skiplist.pdf;,f2!
