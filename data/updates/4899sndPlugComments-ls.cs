A sound buffer is a sequence of "frames", or "slices", where each frame usually includes one sample per channel.  The exception is that for playback, each frame always includes 2 samples; for monaural playback, every other sample is ignored.!!SoundPlugin methodsFor: 'primitives' stamp: 'ls 4/28/2002 15:32'!primitiveSoundAvailableSpace	"Returns the number of bytes of available sound output buffer space.
