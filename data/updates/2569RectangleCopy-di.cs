'From Squeak2.9alpha of 12 June 2000 [latest update: #2551] on 3 September 2000 at 6:04:17 pm'!"Change Set:		RectangleCopyDate:			3 September 2000Author:			Dan IngallsChanges the semantics to Rectangle>>copy from deep to shallow copy.  This is consistent with the general use of Rectangles as pure objects (ie not stored into after creation).The use of deepCopy had been significant (bad) in the case of subclasses of rectangle, such as CharacterBlock where it cause the text to be copied for every line (this changeset removes the particular work-around).Also removes several methods for copying Points and Rectangles that did not significantly impact performance."!Rectangle removeSelector: #copy!Point removeSelector: #copy!Point removeSelector: #shallowCopy!
