"Change Set:		SubclassResponsibilityDate:			16 September 2001Author:			Bob HartwigThis method in Object sent self subclassResponsibility.  Since it's obviously true that not ALL non-abstract subclasses should override this, this is incorrect.  I changed it to answer false, indicating an unsuccessful drop.  This may seem like a pedantic change, but it's not - the Refactoring Browser derives #isAbstract by looking for senders of #subclassResponsibility, and Object should definitely NOT be considered abstract."!!Object methodsFor: 'drag and drop' stamp: 'bh 9/16/2001 18:10'!acceptDroppingMorph: transferMorph event: evt inMorph: dstListMorph 		^false.! !
