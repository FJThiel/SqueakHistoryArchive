'From Squeak3.7alpha of ''11 September 2003'' [latest update: #5657] on 30 January 2004 at 3:43:15 pm'!"Change Set:		ifEmptyParam-mdDate:			30 January 2004Author:			Marcus DenkerJulian Fitzell posted a changeset to add ifEmpty/ifNotEmpty methods to Collection. Thisis now part of 3.7a.From his changeset preamble:--There was some discussion and it was agreed that they should all take 0-arg blocks in all their forms and we could add #ifEmptyDo:, etc. at a later point if desired.  --Now there's a nice way of having ifEmpty: take both a 0-arg block (like ifNotNil:)and a 1-arg block (like ifNotNilDo:) by using valueWithPossibleArgs: to double-dispatch onthe number of arguments in the block. ifNotEmpty: aBlock	^self isEmpty ifFalse: [aBlock valueWithPossibleArgs: {self}].	enabeling both		#(1) ifNotEmpty: [:i | i first] #(1) ifNotEmpty: ['hello']     This changeset changes ifNotEmpty:/ifNotEmpty:ifEmpty and ifEmpty:ifNotEmpty to usevalueWithPossibleArgs.I think it would be good to have the ifNotNil inlining and the methods to takeboth 0-Arg and 1-Arg blocks, too. I will look into this later."!!Collection methodsFor: 'testing' stamp: 'md 1/30/2004 15:11'!ifEmpty: emptyBlock ifNotEmpty: notEmptyBlock	"Evaluate emptyBlock if I'm empty, notEmptyBlock otherwise"	^ self isEmpty ifTrue: emptyBlock ifFalse: [notEmptyBlock valueWithPossibleArgs: {self}]! !!Collection methodsFor: 'testing' stamp: 'md 1/30/2004 15:08'!ifNotEmpty: aBlock	"Evaluate the block unless I'm empty"	^self isEmpty ifFalse: [aBlock valueWithPossibleArgs: {self}].! !!Collection methodsFor: 'testing' stamp: 'md 1/30/2004 15:11'!ifNotEmpty: notEmptyBlock ifEmpty: emptyBlock	"Evaluate emptyBlock if I'm empty, notEmptyBlock otherwise"	^ self isEmpty ifFalse: [notEmptyBlock valueWithPossibleArgs: {self}] ifTrue: emptyBlock! !
