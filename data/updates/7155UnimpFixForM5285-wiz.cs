'From Squeak3.10beta of 22 July 2007 [latest update: #7154] on 6 November 2007 at 6:44:41 am'!"Reporter: wizSummary: 0005285: [Fix] In 7066  #rootInPasteUp is called but unimplemented.Description: For this one.In a workspace type rootInPasteUp. select itfrom the popup menu request find senders(you'll get TileMorph>>mouseMove:)request implementors (you''ll get there aren't any)get an object get a script for it try to moving the mouse on a tilesometimes you will get a series of debug boxesThis can be stopped with the user interupt key.Additional Information: The method was implemented in 7022 (and maybe later I was just sampling old images until I found it)There were also five senders instead of just one so I suspect it got removed when the other four senders did.I've uploaded Morph>>rootInPasteUp.This seemed to cure the problem.This should be fixed before we release this to someone who might use etoys. Because its pretty likely to be stumbled across just as I did.[OT] The rapid succession of debuggers is probably another bug. I'll wait to see if I stumble upon it in a solid fashion before reporting it to mantis."!"To follow this seehttp://bugs.squeak.org/view.php?id= 5285"ReleaseBuilderFor3dot10 new loadTogether: #('EToys-edc.27.mcz' ) merge: false.!
