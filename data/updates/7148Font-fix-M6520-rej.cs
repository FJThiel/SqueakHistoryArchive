'From Squeak3.10beta of 22 July 2007 [latest update: #7147] on 4 November 2007 at 8:53:46 am'!"Reporter: RalphJohnsonSummary: 0006520: recursive fonts cause crash when running testsDescription: When I try to run all tests in 3.10alpha.7105, the image often crashes.  Sometimes I can run the tests once, but the second time I run them then the system crashes.  The problem is that a TTCFont has itself as its "fallbackFont", and this causes infinite recursion in methods like #ascent.  I fixed #ascent but something else broke.Diego Deck worked on this. He said  <<<The problem (the one I found) is fired fromLocaleTest>>testLocaleChanged. Probably the problem is that the firstround of test-runs change the default fonts, and the #localeChangedpropagation fires TTCFont>>setupDefaultFallbackFont, that changes thereceiver's fallbackFont to the default font.>>>Diego gave me the a .cs file with two changed methods.  This solves the problem for me.Now I can run tests over and over without any problems, though several tests fail that did not fail before.Additional Information: "!"To follow this seehttp://bugs.squeak.org/view.php?id= 6520"ReleaseBuilderFor3dot10 new loadTogether: (Array with:'Graphics-edc.42.mcz' with:'Multilingual-edc.29.mcz') merge: false.!
