Although the receiver has reported its minimal size before the actual size it has may differ from what would be after the layout. Normally, this isn't a real problem, but if we have #shrinkWrap constraints then the receiver's bounds may be larger than the cellBounds. THAT is a problem because the centering may not work correctly if the receiver shrinks after the owner layout has been computed. To avoid this problem, we compute the receiver's layout now.
