'From Squeak3.2alpha of 8 October 2001 [latest update: #4646] on 10 January 2002 at 2:35:51 pm'!"Change Set:		CharacterBlockScannerFix-slgDate:			10 January 2002Author:			Steve GilbertThis change fixes a problem that I discovered running Scamper against System 3.2alpha #4646.Grab a virgin instance of Scamper (pointing to browser:about).Move the mouse to the area with the 4 bulleted and highlighted items.A walkback occurs due to the lack of setting of the leftMargin attribute of CharacterBlockScanner.This change moves the self setStopConditions below the the leftMargin setting code again to correct the problem.!!CharacterBlockScanner methodsFor: 'scanning' stamp: 'slg 1/10/2002 13:55'!characterBlockAtPoint: aPoint index: index in: textLine	"This method is the Morphic characterBlock finder.
