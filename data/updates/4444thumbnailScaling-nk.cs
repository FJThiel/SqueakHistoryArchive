You can see this in the StringMorph and Clock thumbnails.This fixes the scaling so that the aspect ratio is maintained.The thumbnail cache is cleared, so it may take a few secondsto see some of the objects tool pages the first time."!!Thumbnail methodsFor: 'thumnail creation' stamp: 'nk 10/18/2001 09:52'!makeThumbnailFromForm: aForm	"Make a thumbnail from the form provided, obeying my min and max width and height preferences"	|  scaleX scaleY |	scaleY _ minimumHeight / aForm height.
