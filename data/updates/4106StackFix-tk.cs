When the contents of a field was stored into the CArdPlayer, it was not being copied.  The same Text object then lived on the background and in the card data.  When a new card was created, modifed and stored, the same Text object was stored for it also!!"!!StackMorph methodsFor: 'menu' stamp: 'tk 5/30/2001 12:25'!findViaTemplate	| list pl cardInst |	"Current card is the template.
