It would occur in existing windows when the alternativeScrollbarLook preference is toggled.  This will also fix the problem in old windows such as the Welcome To... window, etc.  The fixed method simply checks which button is the lower of the two."!!ScrollBar methodsFor: 'geometry' stamp: 'dew 2/5/2002 14:25'!totalSliderArea	| upperBoundsButton |	upperBoundsButton _ menuButton ifNil: [upButton].	upButton bottom > upperBoundsButton bottom		ifTrue: [upperBoundsButton _ upButton].	^ bounds isWide		ifTrue: [upperBoundsButton bounds topRight corner: downButton bounds bottomLeft]		ifFalse: [upperBoundsButton bounds bottomLeft corner: downButton bounds topRight].! !
