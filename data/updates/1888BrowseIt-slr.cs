'From Squeak2.8alpha of 4 February 2000 [latest update: #1873] on 26 February 2000 at 7:12:17 pm'!"Change Set:		BrowseItDate:			11 February 2000Author:			Steve ReesMinor fix to browseIt on ParagraphEditor.Previously ParagraphEditor assumed that a selection beginning with an uppercase letter represented a Class name and that a selection beginning with a lowercase letter was a method name.Whilst the second assumption is valid, the first is not, since although conventionally method names begin with a lowercase letter they can also begin with an uppercase letter.This changeset modifies the assumptions in ParagraphEditor>>browseIt so that if the selected name begins with an uppercase letter, but no entry is found in Smalltalk a search is done for implementing methods with that name."!!ParagraphEditor methodsFor: 'menu messages' stamp: 'slr 2/11/2000 02:19'!browseIt	"Launch a browser for the current selection, if appropriate"	| aSymbol anEntry brow |	self lineSelectAndEmptyCheck: [^ self].	(aSymbol _ self selectedSymbol) isNil ifTrue: [^ view flash].	self terminateAndInitializeAround:		[aSymbol first isUppercase			ifTrue:				[anEntry _ (Smalltalk					at: aSymbol					ifAbsent:						[Smalltalk browseAllImplementorsOf: aSymbol.						^ nil]).				anEntry isNil ifTrue: [^ view flash].				(anEntry isKindOf: Class)					ifFalse:	[anEntry _ anEntry class].				brow _ Preferences browseToolClass new.				brow setClass: anEntry selector: nil.				brow class					openBrowserView: (brow openEditString: nil)					label: 'System Browser']			ifFalse:				[Smalltalk browseAllImplementorsOf: aSymbol]]! !
