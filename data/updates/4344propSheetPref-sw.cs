'From Squeak3.1alpha of 28 February 2001 [latest update: #4343] on 20 September 2001 at 12:18:55 am'!"Change Set:		propSheetPref-swDate:			20 September 2001Author:			Scott WallaceMakes the Property Sheet and the simple Color Picker both always directly available from the morph halo.  A new preference, #propertySheetFromHalo, governs which of the two choices a simple click on the recoloring halo-handle should put up; shift-click will then put up the opposite one.The default value for the new preference is true, to keep things exactly the same way they were.  If you change #propertySheetFromHalo to false, a simple click on the recoloring handle will now put up the simple, one-click color-picker, and you will need to use shift-click on the recoloring handle to get the full property sheet."Preferences addPreference: #propertySheetFromHalo category: #halos default: true balloonHelp: 'governs whether a full property sheet or a simple "color picker" should be presented when you click on the "recoloring" (eyedropper) halo handle.  If you hold down the *shift* key as you click on the eyedropper, you will get the the reverse choice.'. !!HaloMorph methodsFor: 'private' stamp: 'sw 9/20/2001 00:16'!doRecolor: evt with: aHandle	"The mouse went down in the 'recolor' halo handle.
