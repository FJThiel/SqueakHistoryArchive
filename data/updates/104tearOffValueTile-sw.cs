The effect is most immediately seen in the viewer, where every value readout that represents a number, a boolean, a color, or a player, for example, will deliver a literal tile when you drag from its orange tear-off-tile handle."!!Color methodsFor: 'other' stamp: 'sw 6/10/1998 17:50'!newTileMorphRepresentative	^ ColorTileMorph new colorSwatchColor: self! !!Morph methodsFor: 'dec97 additions' stamp: 'sw 6/10/1998 17:42'!tearOffTile	| aValue |	costumee ifNotNil: [^ costumee tearOffTileForSelf].		(aValue _ self valueAsConstant) ifNotNil:		[^ self world primaryHand attachMorph: aValue newTileMorphRepresentative]. 	^ self assuredCostumee tearOffTileForSelf! !!Morph methodsFor: 'jun98 additions' stamp: 'sw 6/10/1998 17:33'!valueAsConstant	"If the receiver can be perceived by the end-user as bearing a data value of any type other than player-reference, return the literal representing its value at this very moment -- for the purpose of a value-tile being constructed."	^ nil! !!ColorTileMorph methodsFor: 'other' stamp: 'sw 6/10/1998 17:49'!colorSwatchColor: aColor	colorSwatch color: aColor! !!StringMorph methodsFor: 'accessing' stamp: 'sw 6/10/1998 18:03'!valueAsConstant	^ self contents! !!ThumbnailMorph methodsFor: 'all' stamp: 'sw 6/15/1998 15:18'!tearOffTile	(objectToView isKindOf: Player) ifTrue: [^ objectToView tearOffTileForSelf].	objectToView ifNil: [^ nil].	^ objectToView isMorph		ifTrue:			[objectToView]		ifFalse:			[objectToView costume]! !!UpdatingRectangleMorph methodsFor: 'accessing' stamp: 'sw 6/10/1998 17:45'!valueAsConstant	^ self readFromTarget! !!UpdatingStringMorph methodsFor: 'accessing' stamp: 'sw 6/11/1998 16:27'!valueAsConstant	^ self valueFromContents! !
