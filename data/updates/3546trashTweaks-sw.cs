'From Squeak3.1alpha of 5 February 2001 [latest update: #3545] on 7 February 2001 at 10:57:03 pm'!"Change Set:		trashTweaks-swDate:			7 February 2001Author:			Scott WallaceOpening up a trash-can that resided in a flap had become broken with the recent change that made double-click the gesture for opening the trash.  This is now repaired in this update -- the double-click now opens the Scraps-Book squarely in the center of the screen, right on the desktop.Balloon help for the trashcan is improved also.Standard left (Squeak) flap modified such that it again has pop-open/pop-closed behavior on *drag-over*.  This is handy for throwing away something that your hand is carrying -- just drag it over the Squeak tab, then the flap will pop open, and you can drop the unwanted item onto the trashcan found at the bottom of that flap.  This change will not take effect until flaps are reinitialized however."!!PasteUpMorph methodsFor: 'world menu' stamp: 'sw 2/7/2001 20:10'!openScrapsBook: evt	"Open up the Scraps book in the center of the screen"	evt hand world addMorphCentered: Utilities scrapsBook! !!TrashCanMorph methodsFor: 'initialization' stamp: 'sw 2/7/2001 20:18'!initialize	"Initialize the receiver's graphics, name, and balloon-help"	super initialize.	self image: TrashPicOn;		offImage: TrashPic;		pressedImage: TrashPicOn.	self setNameTo: 'Trash'.	self setBalloonText:'To remove an object, drop it on any trash can.
