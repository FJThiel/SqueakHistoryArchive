'From Squeak2.8alpha of 13 January 2000 [latest update: #2299] on 8 June 2000 at 12:45:05 pm'!"Change Set:		resetExtentDate:			8 June 2000Author:			Bob ArningRecent changes to #showScrollBar and #hideScrollBar in 2282HiddenScrollBar-dew have unfortunate side-effects for users of retractable scrollbars - they send #extent: whenever the scrollbar is hidden or shown. This leads to:- long pauses when leaving a text pane with lots of text in which there is a selection- shifting the contents so that the selection is visible.I think both (certainly the first) are undesirable. This change set sends #extent: only when the scrollbars are inboard."!!ScrollPane methodsFor: 'scrolling' stamp: 'RAA 6/8/2000 12:34'!hideScrollBar	(submorphs includes: scrollBar) ifFalse: [^self].	self privateRemoveMorph: scrollBar.	scrollBar privateOwner: nil.	retractableScrollBar ifFalse: [self resetExtent].! !!ScrollPane methodsFor: 'scrolling' stamp: 'RAA 6/8/2000 12:35'!showScrollBar	(submorphs includes: scrollBar) ifTrue: [^self].	self privateAddMorph: scrollBar atIndex: 1.	self resizeScrollBar.	scrollBar changed.	retractableScrollBar ifFalse: [self resetExtent].! !
