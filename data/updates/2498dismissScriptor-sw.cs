'From Squeak2.9alpha of 26 July 2000 [latest update: #2497] on 16 August 2000 at 6:23:37 pm'!"Change Set:		dismissScriptor-swDate:			16 August 2000Author:			Scott WallaceA couple of adjustments designed further to reduce confusion about dismissal/destruction of scripts by etoy users:(1)  The user will no longer be able to drag a script into a trash-can in an ill-advised attempt to destroy the script.(2)  If the user tries to dismiss a script editor via the halo, she is given a warning that this will be destructive (same pink x as the 'destroy script' control in the scriptor's header).NB: A true undo involving pulling discarded scripts out of the trash to restore them is still some distance away.
