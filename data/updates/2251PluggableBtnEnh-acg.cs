GreenbergMany modern GUIs permit a user to click on a button view, and then 'mouse off' (move the cursor so it no longer appears in the button insetBoundingBox) the button view before releasing the mouse button to indicate that the user intended no transaction.  Additionally, if the button view was 'moused off,' the user may again 'mouse on' the button view before releasing the button to go ahead with the button activity.  This changeset implements that protocol.MVC as presently implemented does not permit this -- mousing off a button view passes control to the adjacent view, which can create some cognitive dissonance or distort the view in other ways."!Controller subclass: #PluggableButtonController	instanceVariableNames: 'selector arguments shownAsComplemented '	classVariableNames: ''	poolDictionaries: ''	category: 'ST80-Pluggable Views'!!PluggableButtonController methodsFor: 'basic control sequence' stamp: 'acg 3/13/2000 08:49'!controlInitialize 	"Provide feedback indicating that button has been entered with the mouse down.
