A future update, with time for a little testing, will offer a better solution to broadcasting ownerChanged downward when and only when required."!!PasteUpMorph methodsFor: 'layout' stamp: 'tk 10/22/1998 13:55'!layoutChanged	super layoutChanged.	(self valueOfProperty: #SqueakPage) ifNotNil: [		self setProperty: #pageDirty toValue: true].		"I am the morph of a SqueakPage, I have changed and 		need to be written out again"! !!PasteUpMorph methodsFor: 'world state' stamp: 'RAA 6/20/2000 12:42'!extent: aPoint	super extent: aPoint.	worldState ifNotNil: [		worldState viewBox ifNotNil: [			worldState canvas: nil.			worldState viewBox: bounds		].	].! !
