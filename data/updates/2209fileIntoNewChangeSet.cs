'From Squeak2.8alpha of 19 January 2000 [latest update: #2204] on 24 May 2000 at 12:42:12 pm'!"Change Set:		fileIntoNewChangeSetDate:			24 May 2000Author:			Jim HeyneA recent change to FileList>>fileIntoNewChangeSet names the resulting change set with the full path of the file, not just the file name.  This is not too bad, but if the path includes a period, the name is truncated by a subsequent call to #sansPeriodSuffix -- and all changes loaded from that path are given the same name!!This amends FileList>>fileIntoNewChangeSet to use only the fileName (sans path) as the name of the change set."!!FileList methodsFor: 'file list menu' stamp: 'jwh 5/24/2000 12:35'!fileIntoNewChangeSet	"File in all of the contents of the currently selected file,	if any, into a new change set." 	| fn ff |	listIndex = 0 ifTrue: [^ self].	ff _ directory readOnlyFileNamed: (fn _ self uncompressedFileName).	((self getSuffix: fn) sameAs: 'html') ifTrue: [ff _ ff asHtml].	ChangeSorter newChangesFromStream: ff named: (FileDirectory localNameFor: fn)! !
