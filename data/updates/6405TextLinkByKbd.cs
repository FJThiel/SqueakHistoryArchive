I find it astonishing we didn't have this before. Trivial, clean implementation suggested by Ned."!!ParagraphEditor methodsFor: '*garden' stamp: 'dvf 7/28/2003 14:54'!activateTextActions	(paragraph text attributesAt: startBlock stringIndex) 		do: [:att | att actOnClickFor: model in: paragraph]! !!PluggableTextMorph methodsFor: 'event handling' stamp: 'dvf 7/28/2003 14:50'!onKeyStrokeSend: sel to: recipient	textMorph on: #keyStroke send: sel to: recipient.! !
