The inst var in the CardPlayer was created, so the Undeclared variable is just an annoyance.  This fix declared the inst var without putting the name unto Undeclared."!!CardPlayer class methodsFor: 'user-defined inst vars' stamp: 'tk 8/26/2001 16:58'!setNewInstVarNames: listOfStrings	"Make listOfStrings be the new list of instance variable names for the receiver"	| disappearing firstAppearing instVarString instVarList |	instVarList _ self instVarNames asOrderedCollection.	disappearing _ instVarList copy.	disappearing removeAllFoundIn: listOfStrings.	disappearing do:		[:oldName | 	self removeAccessorsFor: oldName].	firstAppearing _ listOfStrings copy.	firstAppearing removeAllFoundIn: instVarList.	instVarString _ String streamContents:		[:aStream | listOfStrings do: [:aString | aStream nextPutAll: aString; nextPut: $ ]].	superclass subclass: self name instanceVariableNames: instVarString 		classVariableNames: '' poolDictionaries: '' category: self categoryForUniclasses.	firstAppearing do:		[:newName | self compileAccessorsFor: newName].! !
