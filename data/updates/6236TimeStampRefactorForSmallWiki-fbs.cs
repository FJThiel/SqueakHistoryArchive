TimeStamp class>>current (as of 3.7-5829) says '^self now'. This, of course, causes an infinite recursion. This changeset reverses #current and #now's relationship so as to avoid this issue. This changeset represents a refactoring, so behaviour won't change."!!TimeStamp class methodsFor: 'squeak protocol' stamp: 'fbs 4/20/2004 14:21'!current	| ts ticks |	ts _ super now.		ticks _ ts ticks.	ticks at: 3 put: 0.	ts ticks: ticks offset: ts offset.		^ ts		! !!TimeStamp class methodsFor: 'ansi protocol' stamp: 'fbs 4/20/2004 14:22'!now	"Answer the current date and time as a TimeStamp."	^self current! !!TimeStamp class reorganize!('deprecated' midnightOn: noonOn:)('*monticello-instance creation' fromMethodTimeStamp: fromString: readFrom:)('squeak protocol' current)('ansi protocol' now)!
