'From Squeak2.9alpha of 13 June 2000 [latest update: #2440] on 7 July 2000 at 9:34:41 am'!"Change Set:		multiProjects7Date:			7 July 2000Author:			Bob ArningWhen saving (publishing) a morphic project whose parent is MVC, several problems were observed:- SystemWindow class variable TopWindow held a reference to a morph in the saving project- the saving happened without changing the active Process. This left other morph references alive on the stack.Both of these problems caused the save to notice morphs pointed to from outside and ask for help. If 'debug' was chosen, nothing happened on the screen since ScheduledControllers was in a funny stateSo the fixes:When leaving a morphic project to go to an MVC project, 1. Clear TopWindow.2. Create a new process (as would happen when going from morphic to morphic).3. Reset some key variables in ScheduledControllers"!!ControlManager methodsFor: 'scheduling' stamp: 'RAA 7/7/2000 09:22'!resetActiveController	"When saving a morphic project whose parent is mvc, we need to set this up first"	activeController _ nil.	activeControllerProcess _ Processor activeProcess.! !!Project methodsFor: 'menu messages' stamp: 'RAA 7/7/2000 09:34'!enter: returningFlag revert: revertFlag saveForRevert: saveForRevert	"Install my ChangeSet, Transcript, and scheduled views as current globals.
