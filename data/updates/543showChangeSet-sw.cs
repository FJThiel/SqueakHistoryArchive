Useful for finding a change set whose name you know but whose position in the chronological list you do not know.(The former implementation of the 'show' command became redundant when a change-set-name-list pane was added to change sorters a while back.)"!!ChangeSorter methodsFor: 'changeSet menu' stamp: 'sw 1/8/1999 14:52'!chooseCngSet	"Present the user with an alphabetical list of change set names, and let her choose one"	| index changeSetsSortedAlphabetically |	self okToChange ifFalse: [^ self].	ChangeSet instanceCount > AllChangeSets size ifTrue: [self class gatherChangeSets].	changeSetsSortedAlphabetically _ AllChangeSets asSortedCollection:		[:a :b | a name asLowercase withoutLeadingDigits < b name asLowercase withoutLeadingDigits].	index _ (PopUpMenu labels: 		(changeSetsSortedAlphabetically collect: [:each | each name]) asStringWithCr) startUp.	index = 0 ifFalse: [self showChangeSet: (changeSetsSortedAlphabetically at: index)].! !!String methodsFor: 'converting' stamp: 'sw 1/8/1999 14:45'!withoutLeadingDigits	"Answer the portion of the receiver that follows any leading series of digits and blanks.
