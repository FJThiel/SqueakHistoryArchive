!Form commentStamp: 'SqR 8/17/2000 15:32' prior: 0!A rectangular array of pixels, used for holding images.  All pictures, including character images are Forms.  The depth of a Form is how many bits are used to specify the color at each pixel.  The actual bits are held in a Bitmap, whose internal structure is different at each depth.  Class Color allows you to deal with colors without knowing how they are actually encoded inside a Bitmap.	  The supported depths (in bits) are 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32.  The number of actual colors at these depths are: 2, 4, 16, 256, 32768, and 16 million.	Forms are combined using BitBlt.  See the comment in class BitBlt.  Forms that are have both transparent and opaque areas are MaskedForms.  Forms that repeat many times to fill a large destination are InfiniteForms.	colorAt: x@y		Returns the abstract color at this location	displayAt: x@y		shows this form on the screen	displayOn: aMedium at: x@y	shows this form in a Window, a Form, or other DisplayMedium	fillColor: aColor		Set all the pixels to the color.	edit		launch an editor to change the bits of this form.	pixelValueAt: x@y	The encoded color.  Depends on the depth.!
