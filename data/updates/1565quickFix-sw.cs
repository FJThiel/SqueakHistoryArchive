In order to be able *quickly* to check whether there has been an external change to the list, we cache the raw list for identity comparison (the actual list is a combination of the --all-- element and the the actual list).!!PluggableMessageCategoryListMorph methodsFor: 'as yet unclassified' stamp: 'sw 10/21/1999 11:12'!verifyContents		| newList existingSelection anIndex newRawList |	(model editSelection == #editComment) ifTrue: [^ self].	model classListIndex = 0 ifTrue: [^ self].	newRawList _ model perform: getRawListSelector.	newRawList == priorRawList ifTrue: [^ self].
