This is a fix for that.	-------------	Change Set:		retainRotationCenter-sw	Date:			25 January 2006	Author:			Scott Wallace	When repainting a sketch, retain any existing rotation-center that may have been specified.	--------------	Change Set:		undoFixes-sw	Date:			2 February 2006	Author:			Scott Wallace	Implements uindo for 'dismiss via halo', which works even if trash is not being preserved.	Make the Undo button in the NavBar dynamically show what action it *would* undo.	Makes that button work propery in a redo situation (formerly it had malfunctioned  when in redo 	mode.)	Elaborates the wording of the 'undo' item to include identification of the target, for resize and rotate 	now, as it always has done for move.	Fixes some bugs encountered along the way.	Fixes the bug that could break undo of a rotation, if an addition or removal of a flex shell was 	involved.	------------------	Change Set:		SuperSwikiString-KR	Date:			1 February 2006	Author:			Korakurider	Current m18n implementation assumes shift_jis encoding is used in wire protocol between	SuperSwiki server and client.  Then some existing projects encoded in other than shift_jis	cause walkback. 	This patch introduces 'encodingName' for ServerDirectory entry (even in knownServer entry) 	so that appropriate encoding can be specified for each server.  If not specified, encoding is 		determined based on current locale.	------------------	Change Set:		rotCenterHaloHelp-sw	Date:			16 February 2006	Author:			Scott Wallace	Supplements the balloon help for the rotation-center handle with the additional informaiton that the 	user should hold down the shift key to move it.	-------------------	Name: Balloon-mir.11	Author: mir	Time: 22 March 2006, 2:14:18 pm	(backported from Jan Fietz' changes)	FlashFileReader support for more image tags:		processDefineBitsJPEG3 (JPEG + alpha channel)		processDefineLossless2	---------------------	Name: Flash-mir.2	Author: mir	Time: 22 March 2006, 3:04 pm	merge with iSqueak flash enh.
