I think this may have accidentally been overwritten with the even older 'self asString' implementation during the m17n updates.  (This isn't critical for 3.8.)For a technical explanation of the bug:  The 'self asString' implementation is really horrible. :-)  It makes it difficult to tell strings from regular objects in the explorer."!!AbstractString methodsFor: 'user interface' stamp: 'dew 12/15/2004 1:03'!asExplorerString	^ self printString! !
