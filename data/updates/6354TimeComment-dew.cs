'From Squeak3.7 of ''4 September 2004'' [latest update: #5989] on 23 October 2004 at 6:04:02 pm'!"Change Set:		TimeComment-dewDate:			23 October 2004Author:			Doug WayFixes the comment for Time.  The comment previously read'This represents a period of time.'which implies a duration or interval of time, which is *not* what Time represents.  It really represents a particular point in time, during an unknown day.  (Although it can be converted to a Duration.)  The new comment reads:'This represents a particular point in time during any given day.  For example, '5:19:45 pm'.If you need a point in time on a particular day, use DateAndTime.  If you need a duration of time, use Duration.'"!!Time commentStamp: 'dew 10/23/2004 17:58' prior: 0!This represents a particular point in time during any given day.
