This bumps MessageTally class>>defaultMaxTabs from 18 to 40.  (Personally I'd prefer about 80 but I understand this would be too wide for some.)Most people developing/debugging in Squeak these days have a screen width of at least 1024 (if not much higher), which is plenty of width to view this.  Also, since the default poll period of MessageTally was decreased, the tally hierarchies have gotten deeper."!!MessageTally class methodsFor: 'defaults' stamp: 'dew 4/2/2005 15:04'!defaultMaxTabs	"Return the default number of tabs after which leading white space is compressed"	^40! !
