It 	looks in the literals array, and so misses the 32 'special' message selectors. The correct code 	is both shorter and simpler. (Andrew Black)	---------------	Morphic:		- 0003416: Faster Moprhic invalidation		  Morph>>invalidRect:from: was testing for wonderland textures (which where stored in 		  a property...). (Thanks to Andrew Black for reporting this).		- Better looking menu title bar (from a mail to the list that I can't find anymore...		   please use mantis if you want your name to appear here ;-))	---------------	Change Set:		ExternalSettingsReorg-tpr	Date:			5 April 2006	Author:			tim@rowledge.org	Reorganise the categories in ExternalSettings to get rid of an explcit '--all--' that can make a 	real mess of filing out the code	--------------		Change Set:		KedamaMissing-KR	Date:			14 April 2006	Author:			Korakurider	add missing method for Kedama	----------------	Change Set:		KedamaWODepreciated-KR	Date:			14 April 2006	Author:			Korakurider	refactor kedama not to call depreciated methods.	note: As showDeprecationWarnings preferece is set to false in Squeakland image, 	original kedama code run without no problem.	------------------	renamed BlockContext>>endpc to be endOC and fix the one sender (md)	------------------	Change Set:		MacRomanFix	Date:			5 April 2006	Author:			Andreas Raab	Raise an error if somebody tries to write wide characters.	----------------------	0003458: PositionableStream>>copyPreamble:from:at: broken  (Andreas)	---------	0003415: Changeset is not updated when renaming a class (Noury)	After renaming a class, the changeset is not updated to refer to the new name. Therefore, 		one virtually lose recorded changes.	The fix also cleans a bit SystemDictionary. It removes method 	SystemDictionary>>renameClass:from: and uses instead SystemDictionary>>renameClass:as: used 	by traits	-----------	0003492: Complete the job of changing the way that arrays are printed (Andrew Black)	Description	The new array printing logic introduced in 3.9 had some holes, and needed some cleanup. 	The attached changeset provides it. Tests are included.	Additional Information	Specifically, the changeset	- marks Fractions as selfEveluating and Booleans as literals	- puts Array>>printOn: back in the printing ctaegory, where someone might expect to find it	- removes duplicated logic from Collection>>printElementsOn:	- adds tests for all of the above.	--------------	faster asUTC from Avi	-------------- 		"!"Postscript:Leave the line above, and replace the rest of this comment by a useful one.Executable statements should follow this comment, and shouldbe separated by periods, with no exclamation points (!!).Be sure to put any further comments in double-quotes, like this one."|repository|repository := MCHttpRepository                location: 'http://source.squeakfoundation.org/39a'                user: ''                password: ''.(repository loadVersionFromFileNamed: 'ScriptLoader-md.172.mcz') load.ScriptLoader new updateFrom7024!
