Instead of #ifCurtailed:  this patch uses [] on: FileStreamException do:[] which will trap any file related problem such as the file not existing or being unreadable. Maybe it will be good enough to help for now."!!UUIDGenerator methodsFor: 'random seed' stamp: 'tpr 12/20/2002 18:02'!makeUnixSeed	| strm answer |	[strm := (FileStream readOnlyFileNamed: '/dev/urandom') binary.	answer := Integer		byte1: strm next		byte2: strm next		byte3: strm next		byte4: strm next.	strm close.	] on: FileStreamException do: [answer := nil].	^answer! !
