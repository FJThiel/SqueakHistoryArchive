But the cartesian getX and getY computations in that situation are still wrong, and to be made right they seemingly would need to factor in the former owner's transformation."!!Morph methodsFor: 'e-toy support' stamp: 'sw 9/11/2004 16:23'!referencePlayfield	"Answer the PasteUpMorph to be used for cartesian-coordinate reference"	| former |	owner ifNotNil:		[(self topRendererOrSelf owner isHandMorph and: [(former _ self formerOwner) notNil])			ifTrue:				[former _ former renderedMorph.				^ former isPlayfieldLike 					ifTrue: [former]					ifFalse: [former referencePlayfield]]].	self allOwnersDo: [:o | o isPlayfieldLike ifTrue: [^ o]].	^ ActiveWorld! !
