"Change Set:		menuMessages-tkLRDate:			4 Nov 1999Author:			Ted Kaehler	Dan's fix, 1578ThreeTweaks-di.cs, removed the redundant methods to get ParagraphEditor's shifted yellow button menu.  	This change removes the separate shiftedYellowButtonMessages query.  Anyone who needs it should generate a menu and then ask for the selections.  Previously, shiftedYellowButtonMessages maintained a separate list, which was always out of date."MouseMenuController removeSelector: #shiftedYellowButtonMessages!ParagraphEditor removeSelector: #shiftedYellowButtonMessages!ParagraphEditor class removeSelector: #shiftedYellowButtonMessages!ScreenController removeSelector: #shiftedYellowButtonMessages!
