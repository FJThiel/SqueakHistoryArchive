The objects they represent are in SqueakPages, and are not really in this image.  Do not want to bring them all in!!ImageSegmentRootStub		Skip them.  Might stand for a class, or its segment might contain a class.  But, that class can't be the one being cleaned up now.  If instances of the class being fixed are in a segment, the class is in the outPointers, and will be found normally."! !
