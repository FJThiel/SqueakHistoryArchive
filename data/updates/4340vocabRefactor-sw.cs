'From Squeak3.1alpha of 28 February 2001 [latest update: #4337] on 14 September 2001 at 00:00:01 am'!"Change Set:		vocabRefactor-swDate:			14 September 2001Author:			Scott WallaceRefactors Vocabulary architecture, making the choice of natural language an independent dimension, with actual translations instituted lazily only when required by user request.Every project has a natural language associated with it; default is English.  When you switch natural languages (there is a new item in the Help menu to do this,) the impact will only be seriously felt in the classic tile-scripting regime, where all viewers and scriptors will immediately be re-rendered in the new language.  Ultimately, broader localization would be desirable -- menus, balloon help, labels, and much else.Refactors ObjectWithDocumentation to provide direct support for multiple natural languages.Attention translators: consult EToyVocabulary method #templateForLanguageTranslation -- this method is provided to assist people wishing to translate the etoy experience into another natural language.  If you carefully follow the instructions in the comment at the front of that method, it should be straightforward to translate to any language.Note to Alan and Ted:  This refactoring recasts the 'players are vectors' thing as a separate vocabulary.  To switch any particular *viewer* over to using the Vector vocabulary, use 'choose vocabulary' from the viewer's menu; to switch an entire *project* over to the 'players are vectors' mode, evaluate 'ActiveWorld installVectorVocabulary.', which will be found at the bottom of the 'do...' menu.  To rescind a project-wide vocabulary choice, evaluate 'ActiveWorld abandonVocabularyPreference.', also found in the 'do...' menu."!Object subclass: #ElementTranslation	instanceVariableNames: 'wording helpMessage naturalLanguageSymbol '	classVariableNames: ''	poolDictionaries: ''	category: 'System-Protocols'!Object subclass: #ObjectWithDocumentation	instanceVariableNames: 'authoringStamp documentation properties elementSymbol naturalLanguageTranslations '	classVariableNames: ''	poolDictionaries: ''	category: 'System-Protocols'!ObjectWithDocumentation subclass: #Vocabulary	instanceVariableNames: 'vocabularyName categories methodInterfaces object limitClass translationTable '	classVariableNames: 'AllVocabularies AllMethodInterfaces AllStandardVocabularies  '	poolDictionaries: ''	category: 'System-Protocols'!EToyVocabulary subclass: #EToyVectorVocabulary	instanceVariableNames: ''	classVariableNames: ''	poolDictionaries: ''	category: 'System-Protocols'!!EToyVectorVocabulary commentStamp: '<historical>' prior: 0!An extension of the etoy vocabulary in support of an experiment Alan Kay requested in summer 2001 for allowing any morph/player to be thought of as a vector.
