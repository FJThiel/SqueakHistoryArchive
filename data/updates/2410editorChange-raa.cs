'From Squeak2.9alpha of 13 June 2000 [latest update: #2407] on 15 June 2000 at 2:03:58 pm'!"Change Set:            editorChangeDate:                   15 June 2000Author:                 Bob ArningSuitable for 2.8 and 2.9alphaA little fix for the #printIt changes previously made. It is unadvisable to replace the old editor when the paragraph has changed. To see what I mean (before you install this, of course),-open a browser (seems to happen most in a new browser)-select a method (Boolean>>and:, e.g.)-move the mouse into the code pane-add a few z's in front of the method name-save (keyboard cmd-s - do NOT let the mouse leave the code pane)-try to select text with the mouse. It won't work for me, although once the mouse leaves the pane and returns, all is well again.The problem was that the auto code updating replaced the paragraph and then I restored the old editor which was still pointing to the old paragraph. Bad combo."!!TextMorph methodsFor: 'editing' stamp: 'RAA 6/15/2000 13:43'!handleInteraction: interactionBlock fromEvent: evt        | oldEditor oldParagraph |        "Perform the changes in interactionBlock, noting any change in selection"        "Also couple ParagraphEditor to Morphic keyboard events"        self editor sensor: (KeyboardBuffer new startingEvent: evt).        oldEditor _ editor.        oldParagraph _ paragraph.        self selectionChanged.
