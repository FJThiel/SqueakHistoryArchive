They had a 2-pixel inset that other phrase tiles lacked, and they also had a pale green background that extended the entire width of the Scriptor.  This update fixes both those problems.Earlier published to Squeakland as update 0209phraseInsetFix-sw.cs; this 3.8a-intended update is identical to that."!!ScriptEditorMorph methodsFor: 'initialization' stamp: 'sw 4/10/2004 00:59'!phrase: aPhraseTileMorph	"Make the receiver be a Scriptor for a new script whose initial contents is the given phrase."	| aHolder |	firstTileRow _ 2.	aHolder _ AlignmentMorph newRow.	aHolder beTransparent; layoutInset: 0.	aHolder addMorphBack: aPhraseTileMorph.	self addMorphBack: aHolder.	self install! !
