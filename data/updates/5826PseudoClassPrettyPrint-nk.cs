I'm not exactly sure how PseudoClass is supposed to work so I don't know if this is considered a bug (*) in that class but I think that the browser should non-pretty print the text if parsing fails.This CS adds instVarNames to PseudoClass to avoid this bug."!!PseudoClass methodsFor: 'accessing' stamp: 'nk 3/9/2004 10:24'!instVarNames	^ #()! !
