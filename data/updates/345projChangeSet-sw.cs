(The old workaround was to exit and reenter the project!!)  The fix consists of eagerly updating the project's change set whenever Smalltalk newChanges: is called, rather than only upon project exit."!!SystemDictionary methodsFor: 'sources, change log' stamp: 'sw 10/6/1998 14:36'!newChanges: aChangeSet 	"Set the system ChangeSet to be the argument, aChangeSet.  Tell the current project that aChangeSet is now its change set.  When called from Project enter:, the setChangeSet: call is redundant but harmless; when called from code that changes the current-change-set from within a project, it's vital"	SystemChanges _ aChangeSet.	Project current setChangeSet: aChangeSet! !
