Another click is required to drop a morph picked up with a click, but morphs picked up with a drag are dropped at the end of the drag.Such was not the case for morphs created via the dup handle; they have always required another click to drop them.  This has been a niggly ever since the 'click' behavior replaced the 'drag' behavior.  Now both work!!"!!HaloMorph methodsFor: 'private' stamp: 'jcg 5/30/2002 09:12'!doDup: evt with: dupHandle	"Ask hand to duplicate my target."	(target isKindOf: SelectionMorph) ifTrue:		[^ target doDup: evt fromHalo: self handle: dupHandle].	self obtainHaloForEvent: evt andRemoveAllHandlesBut: dupHandle.	self setTarget: (target duplicateMorph: evt).	evt hand grabMorph: target.	self step.
