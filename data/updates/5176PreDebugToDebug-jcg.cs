'From Squeak3.4 of 1 March 2003 [latest update: #5170] on 7 March 2003 at 1:51:28 am'!"Change Set:		PreDebugToDebugFixDate:			7 March 2003Author:			Joshua GargusA 'fade-out' effect was observed going from the PreDebug window to the Debug window.  This was caused by the PreDebug window being drawn after its model was deleted, but before it was deleted.  This fix causes it to be deleted before the full Debug window is open.  There is also a nice usability side effect: before, the full debug window would be likely to open somewhere else on the screen (where ever the real-estate manager found room for it).  Now, it is likely to open on the spot vacated by the PreDebug window.
