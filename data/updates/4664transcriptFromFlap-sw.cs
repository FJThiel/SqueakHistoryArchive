'From Squeak3.3alpha of 12 January 2002 [latest update: #4657] on 29 January 2002 at 7:58:44 pm'!"Change Set:		transcriptFromFlap-swDate:			29 January 2002Author:			Scott WallaceFixes the bug that a transcript obtained from a Tools flap when not in the top project would not behave properly.  Replaces the errant Tools Flap with one that does not have the bug, provided the user has the preference governing the reinitialization of flaps set to true.  Also fixed is the less-well-known bug that an Objects Tool that was created in one project and then transferred to another via a flap would also deliver up a flawed Transcript.  (Preexisting instances of the Object Tool may however retain the flaw.)"!!Flaps class methodsFor: 'predefined flaps' stamp: 'sw 1/29/2002 16:52'!quadsDefiningToolsFlap	"Answer a structure defining the default Tools flap"	^ #(	(Browser 				prototypicalToolWindow		'Browser'			'A Browser is a tool that allows you to view all the code of all the classes in the system')	(TranscriptStream				openMorphicTranscript				'Transcript'			'A Transcript is a window usable for logging and debugging; browse references to #Transcript for examples of how to write to it.')	(Workspace				prototypicalToolWindow		'Workspace'			'A Workspace is a simple window for editing text.
