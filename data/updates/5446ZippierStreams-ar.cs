'From Squeak3.6beta of ''4 July 2003'' [latest update: #5395] on 12 August 2003 at 5:00:35 pm'!"Change Set:		ZippierStreamsDate:			12 August 2003Author:			Andreas RaabThis change set speeds up various stream writing operations. It was created when I noticed how much time ZipArchive spends during extracting its contents. For the Balloon3D.sar (which I used for profiling) decompression speed improved 	from: 	2,881 msecs	to:		172 msecsWhich is roughly 17 times faster. The benchmark used was:file := FileStream readOnlyFileNamed: 'Balloon3D.1.0.4.sar'.MessageTally spyOn:[	archive := ZipArchive new readFrom: file.	archive members do:[:mbr| mbr contents].].file close."!!PositionableStream methodsFor: 'accessing' stamp: 'ar 8/12/2003 16:56'!next: anInteger putAll: aCollection startingAt: startIndex	"Store the next anInteger elements from the given collection."	(startIndex = 1 and:[anInteger = aCollection size])		ifTrue:[^self nextPutAll: aCollection].	^self nextPutAll: (aCollection copyFrom: startIndex to: startIndex+anInteger-1)! !!RWBinaryOrTextStream methodsFor: 'writing' stamp: 'ar 8/12/2003 16:54'!next: anInteger putAll: aCollection startingAt: startIndex	^super next: anInteger putAll: aCollection asString startingAt: startIndex! !!RWBinaryOrTextStream methodsFor: 'writing' stamp: 'ar 8/12/2003 16:54'!nextPutAll: aCollection	^super nextPutAll: aCollection asString! !
