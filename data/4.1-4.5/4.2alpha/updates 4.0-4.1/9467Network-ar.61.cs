"Change Set:		9467Network-ar.61Network-ar.61:Provide implementations of SocketStream #nextInto:, #next:into: #nextInto:startingAt: and #next:into:startingAt:. These methods are useful to avoid excessive allocations when streaming because the buffer can be passed to SocketStream without requiring a full buffer allocation per call (as would be the case in next: or nextAvailable:)."!!SocketStream methodsFor: 'stream in' stamp: 'ar 2/23/2010 13:06'!next: n into: aCollection	"Read n objects into the given collection.	Return aCollection or a partial copy if less than	n elements have been read."	^self next: n into: aCollection startingAt: 1! !!SocketStream methodsFor: 'stream in' stamp: 'ar 2/23/2010 13:06'!nextInto: aCollection startingAt: startIndex	"Read the next elements of the receiver into aCollection.	Return aCollection or a partial copy if less than aCollection	size elements have been read."	^self next: (aCollection size - startIndex+1) into: aCollection startingAt: startIndex.! !!SocketStream methodsFor: 'stream in' stamp: 'ar 2/23/2010 13:05'!next: anInteger into: aCollection startingAt: startIndex	"Read n objects into the given collection. 	Return aCollection or a partial copy if less than	n elements have been read."	"Implementation note: This method DOES signal timeout if not 	enough elements are received.
