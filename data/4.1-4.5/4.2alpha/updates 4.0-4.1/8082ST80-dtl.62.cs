"Change Set:		8082ST80-dtl.62ST80-dtl.62:Fix ScreenController>>openMenu which had menu separator lines in the wrong position, and which opened a Morphic project in response to 'open... ->mvc project'. This change restores the original menu structure, except that 'open... ->morphic project' and 'open... ->morphic world' are now displayed only if Morphic is present in the image, as per presumed intent of the prior change to #openMenu.Open concerns: The 'open... -> keep this menu up' option, restored to the menu by this change, and 'open... ->mvc project' options, which now attempts to open an mvc (not morphic) project, are both badly broken and will cause image freeze. The 'open... ->file list' and 'open... ->morphic world' selections (not related to this menu change) are also broken, probably for the same reason.ST80-dtl.61:Add #defaultBackgroundColor (moved from Project to MVCProject)"!!ScreenController methodsFor: 'nested menus' stamp: 'dtl 10/31/2009 19:32'!openMenuWithMorphicOptions	"Include 'morphic world' and 'morphic project' selections"	^ SelectionMenu labelList:		#(	'keep this menu up'			'browser'			'package browser'			'method finder'			'workspace'			'file list'			'file...'			'transcript'			'morphic world'			'simple change sorter'			'dual change sorter'			'mvc project'			'morphic project'			)		lines: #(1 9 11)		selections: #(durableOpenMenuopenBrowser openPackageBrowser openSelectorBrowser openWorkspace openFileList openFile openTranscript openMorphicWorldopenSimpleChangeSorter openChangeManageropenProject  openMorphicProject  )"ScreenController  new openMenuWithMorphicOptions startUp"! !!MVCProject methodsFor: 'initialize' stamp: 'dtl 10/31/2009 15:34'!defaultBackgroundColor	^ Color r: 1.0 g: 1.0 b: 0.065! !!ScreenController methodsFor: 'nested menus' stamp: 'dtl 10/31/2009 19:27'!openMenu	"Smalltalk hasMorphic ifTrue: [^self openMenuWithMorphicOptions]."	^ SelectionMenu labelList:		#(	'keep this menu up'			'browser'			'package browser'			'method finder'			'workspace'			'file list'			'file...'			'transcript'			'simple change sorter'			'dual change sorter'			'new project'			)		lines: #(1 8 10)		selections: #(durableOpenMenuopenBrowser openPackageBrowser openSelectorBrowser openWorkspace openFileList openFile openTranscriptopenSimpleChangeSorter openChangeManageropenProject   )"ScreenController  new openMenu startUp"! !
