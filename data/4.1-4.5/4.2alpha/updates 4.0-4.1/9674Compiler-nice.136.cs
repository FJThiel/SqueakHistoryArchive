"Change Set:		9674Compiler-nice.136Compiler-nice.136:Multiple automatic AmbigousSelector replacement was broken dur to subtle requestorOffset magic. Attempt a correction.I just made the replacement work, but the second occurence selection just flash , I don't know why.I do not really understand what I programmed... This is a door open to future bugs.The requestorOffset inst var in Parser looks like a fragile construction to me. I dont understand selectInvisiblyFrom:to: neither...Not sure what happens if we mix UnsedVariable, AmbiguousSelector and other automatic corrections.Probably more work on this subject"!!Parser methodsFor: 'error correction' stamp: 'nice 3/10/2010 09:29'!ambiguousSelector: aString inRange: anInterval	| correctedSelector userSelection offset intervalWithOffset |		self interactive ifFalse: [		"In non interactive mode, compile with backward comapatibility: $- is part of literal argument"		Transcript cr; store: encoder classEncoding; nextPutAll:#'>>';store: encoder selector; show: ' would send ' , token , '-'.		token := token asSymbol.		^self].		"handle the text selection"	userSelection := requestor selectionInterval.	intervalWithOffset := anInterval first + requestorOffset to: anInterval last + requestorOffset.	requestor selectFrom: intervalWithOffset first to: intervalWithOffset last.	requestor select.	"Build the menu with alternatives"	correctedSelector := AmbiguousSelector 			signalName: aString			inRange: intervalWithOffset.	correctedSelector ifNil: [^self fail].	"Execute the selected action"	offset := self substituteWord: correctedSelector wordInterval: intervalWithOffset offset: 0.	requestor deselect.	requestor selectInvisiblyFrom: userSelection first to: userSelection last + offset.	token := (correctedSelector readStream upTo: Character space) asSymbol! !
