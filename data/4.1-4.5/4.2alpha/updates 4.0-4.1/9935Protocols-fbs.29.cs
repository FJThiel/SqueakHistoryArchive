"Change Set:		9935Protocols-fbs.29Protocols-fbs.29:This commit adds the menu, 'only through...' and method home buttons back to the Lexicon. It's a minimal commit that neglects any attempt at cleanup: Lexicon>>buildCustomButtonsWith: could be deleted, for instance.One weird thing happens to me: when I file in the changeset version of this commit. hitting Cmd-P blows up with an MNU. Recompiling Lexicon>>customButtonSpec (by, say, deleting and then readding a character) fixes the problem though!"!!Lexicon methodsFor: 'control buttons' stamp: 'fbs 4/13/2010 16:43'!customButtonSpecs	"Answer a triplet defining buttons, in the format:			button label			selector to send			help message"	| aa |	aa := contentsSymbol == #tiles ifTrue: [{   "Consult Ted Kaehler regarding this bit"	{'tiles'.				#tilesMenu.
