"Change Set:		9379Files-cmm.68Files-cmm.68:Refactored DirectoryEntry.  Highlights:- Moved DirectoryEntry from a subclass of ArrayedCollection to a subclass of Object.- Each DirectoryEntry now knows its 'directory' (a FileDirectory).  At last, DirectoryEntry's are useful enough to serve as first-class 'file reference' objects that have otherwise, thus far, been relegated to platform-specific Strings.- Behaviors exclusive to DirectoryEntry's representing files have been moved to DirectoryEntryFile.  Behaviors exclusive to DirectoryEntry's representing directory's have been moved into DirectoryEntryDirectory.  The DirectoryEntry>>'dirFlag' variable has been removed.- Added a terse, platform-independent way of expressing FileDirectory concatenation via the #/ operator:		myFileDirectory / 'subDir' / 'sub-subDir'"!Object subclass: #DirectoryEntry	instanceVariableNames: 'directory name creationTime modificationTime fileSize'	classVariableNames: ''	poolDictionaries: ''	category: 'Files-Directories'!DirectoryEntry subclass: #DirectoryEntryFile	instanceVariableNames: ''	classVariableNames: ''	poolDictionaries: ''	category: 'Files-Directories'!DirectoryEntry subclass: #DirectoryEntryDirectory	instanceVariableNames: ''	classVariableNames: ''	poolDictionaries: ''	category: 'Files-Directories'!!DirectoryEntry methodsFor: 'access' stamp: 'cmm 8/10/2007 12:25'!creationDateAndTime	"The DateAndTime my entry in the file system was created."	^DateAndTime fromSeconds: creationTime! !!DirectoryEntryDirectory methodsFor: 'file operations' stamp: 'cmm 10/5/2007 17:41'!copyHere: aDirectoryEntryFile	"Copy aDirectoryFileEntry, which represents a file, to the directory I represent."	^ self asFileDirectory copyHere: aDirectoryEntryFile! !!DirectoryEntry methodsFor: 'access' stamp: 'cmm 8/29/2007 17:44'!printOn: aStream 	super printOn: aStream.	aStream		space ;		nextPutAll: self name! !!DirectoryEntryFile methodsFor: 'file operations' stamp: 'cmm 9/27/2007 11:49'!copyTo: targetDirectory 	"Make a copy of me in targetDirectory.  targetDirectory can be a FileDirectory, ServerDirectory or a DirectoryEntryDirectory.
