"Change Set:		7775ToolBuilder-Morphic-laza.38ToolBuilder-Morphic-laza.38:I recognized, that SystemProgressMorph got extended to support changing the label during progress display. This was not fully supported and I changed that. What was also missing was the realignment.In additon SystemProgressMorph now supports label only display and handles informUserDuring:. See the examples for details.I also changed the font and some of the look and layout.ToolBuilder-Morphic-ar.36:For widgets that have an explicit id/name associated with them, set the external name of the morph to the same name. This allows finding such a morph in its top-level window via #submorphNamed: etc.ToolBuilder-Morphic-laza.37:"!!MorphicUIManager methodsFor: 'ui requests' stamp: 'laza 9/7/2009 22:39'!informUserDuring: aBlock	"Display a message above (or below if insufficient room) the cursor 	during execution of the given block.		UIManager default informUserDuring:[:bar|			#(one two three) do:[:info|				bar value: info.				(Delay forSeconds: 1) wait]]"	SystemProgressMorph		informUserAt: Sensor cursorPoint during: aBlock.! !!MorphicToolBuilder methodsFor: 'private' stamp: 'ar 9/6/2009 16:14'!register: widget id: id	id ifNil:[^self].	widgets ifNil:[widgets := Dictionary new].	widgets at: id put: widget.	widget setNameTo: id.! !
