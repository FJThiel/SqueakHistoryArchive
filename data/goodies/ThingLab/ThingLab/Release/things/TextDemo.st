At that time, eight Terran years after the founding of the first human colony on Luna, an interplanetary trip made by humans had to be made in free-fall orbits--from Terra to Mars, two hundred-fifty-eight Terran days, the same for return, plus four hundred fifty-five days waiting at Mars while the planets crawled back into positions for the return orbit.Only by refueling at a space station could the Envoy make the trip.  Once at Mars she might return--if she did not crash, if water could be found to fill her reaction taks, if a thousand things did not go wrong.' runs: (RunArray runs: #(27 587 5 160 ) values: (Array with: (Array with: TextFontChange font2) with: (Array with: TextFontChange font1) with: (Array with: TextFontChange font3) with: (Array with: TextFontChange font1) ))); instVarAt: 3 put: 3; instVarAt: 4 put: 2; instVarAt: 5 put: 2; instVarAt: 6 put: 2; instVarAt: 7 put: -1000; instVarAt: 8 put: nil; yourself); yourself)!TextDemo prototype instVarAt: 2 put: (Rectangle origin: (Point x: 79 y: 35) corner: (Point x: 427 y: 339))!TextDemo prototype merge: #( 'variableHeightText1 text frame origin' 'rectangle2 origin')!TextDemo prototype merge: #( 'variableHeightText1 text frame corner' 'rectangle2 corner')!TextDemo prototype performAllMerges!
